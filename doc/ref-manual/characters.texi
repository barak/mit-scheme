@section External Representation of Characters
@cindex external representation, for character

@cindex #\ as external representation
@findex #\
Characters are written using the notation @code{#\@var{character}} or
@code{#\@var{character-name}}.  For example:

@example
@group
#\a                     @r{; lowercase letter}
#\A                     @r{; uppercase letter}
#\(                     @r{; left parenthesis}
#\space                 @r{; the space character}
#\newline               @r{; the newline character}
@end group
@end example
@findex #\space
@findex #\newline

@noindent
Case is significant in @code{#\@var{character}}, but not in
@code{#\@var{character-name}}.  If @var{character} in
@code{#\@var{character}} is a letter, @var{character} must be followed
by a delimiter character such as a space or parenthesis.  Characters
written in the @code{#\} notation are self-evaluating; you don't need to
quote them.

@findex #\U+
In addition to the standard character syntax, MIT Scheme also supports a
general syntax that denotes any Unicode character by its scalar value.
This notation is @code{#\U+@var{scalar-value}}, where @var{scalar-value} is
a sequence of hexadecimal digits for a valid scalar value.  So the above
examples could also be written like this:

@example
@group
#\U+61                  @r{; lowercase letter}
#\U+41                  @r{; uppercase letter}
#\U+28                  @r{; left parenthesis}
#\U+20                  @r{; the space character}
#\U+0A                  @r{; the newline character}
@end group
@end example

@cindex bucky bit, prefix (defn)
@cindex control, bucky bit prefix (defn)
@cindex meta, bucky bit prefix (defn)
@cindex super, bucky bit prefix (defn)
@cindex hyper, bucky bit prefix (defn)
A character name may include one or more @dfn{bucky bit} prefixes to
indicate that the character includes one or more of the keyboard shift
keys Control, Meta, Super, or Hyper (note that the Control bucky bit
prefix is not the same as the @acronym{ASCII} control key).  The bucky
bit prefixes and their meanings are as follows (case is not
significant):

@example
@group
Key             Bucky bit prefix        Bucky bit
---             ----------------        ---------

Meta            M- or Meta-                 1
Control         C- or Control-              2
Super           S- or Super-                4
Hyper           H- or Hyper-                8
@end group
@end example

@noindent
For example,

@example
@group
#\c-a                   @r{; Control-a}
#\meta-b                @r{; Meta-b}

@cindex character, named (defn)
@cindex name, of character
The following @var{character-name}s are supported, shown here with their
@acronym{ASCII} equivalents:

@example
@group

@noindent
@cindex newline character (defn)
@findex #\newline
In addition, @code{#\newline} is the same as @code{#\linefeed} (but this
may change in the future, so you should not depend on it).  All of the
standard @acronym{ASCII} names for non-printing characters are supported:

@example
@group
NUL     SOH     STX     ETX     EOT     ENQ     ACK     BEL
BS      HT      LF      VT      FF      CR      SO      SI

DEL
@end group
@end example

@deffn procedure char->name char [slashify?]
Returns a string corresponding to the printed representation of
@var{char}.  This is the @var{character} or @var{character-name}
component of the external representation, combined with the appropriate
bucky bit prefixes.

@example
@group
(char->name #\a)                        @result{}  "a"
(char->name #\space)                    @result{}  "Space"
(char->name #\c-a)                      @result{}  "C-a"
(char->name #\control-a)                @result{}  "C-a"
@end group
@end example

@findex read
@var{Slashify?}, if specified and true, says to insert the necessary
backslash characters in the result so that @code{read} will parse it
correctly.  In other words, the following generates the external
representation of @var{char}:

@example
(string-append "#\\" (char->name @var{char} #t))
@end example

@noindent
If @var{slashify?} is not specified, it defaults to @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure name->char string
Converts a string that names a character into the character specified.
If @var{string} does not name any character, @code{name->char} signals
an error.

@example
@group
(name->char "a")                        @result{}  #\a
(name->char "space")                    @result{}  #\Space
(name->char "c-a")                      @result{}  #\C-a
(name->char "control-a")                @result{}  #\C-a

@node Comparison of Characters, Miscellaneous Character Operations, External Representation of Characters, Characters
@section Comparison of Characters
@cindex ordering, of characters
@cindex comparison, of characters
@cindex equivalence predicates, for characters

@deffn procedure char=? char1 char2
@deffnx procedure char<? char1 char2
@deffnx procedure char>? char1 char2
@deffnx procedure char<=? char1 char2
@deffnx procedure char>=? char1 char2

@deffnx {procedure} char-ci>? char1 char2
@deffnx {procedure} char-ci<=? char1 char2
@deffnx {procedure} char-ci>=? char1 char2
@cindex equivalence predicate, for characters
Returns @code{#t} if the specified characters are have the appropriate
order relationship to one another; otherwise returns @code{#f}.  The
@code{-ci} procedures don't distinguish uppercase and lowercase letters.

Character ordering follows these portability rules:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The digits are in order; for example, @code{(char<? #\0 #\9)} returns
@code{#t}.

@item
The uppercase characters are in order; for example, @code{(char<? #\A
#\B)} returns @code{#t}.

@item
The lowercase characters are in order; for example, @code{(char<? #\a
#\b)} returns @code{#t}.
@end itemize

MIT/GNU Scheme uses a specific character ordering, in which characters
have the same order as their corresponding integers.  See the
documentation for @code{char->integer} for further details.

@strong{Note}: Although character objects can represent all of Unicode,
the model of alphabetic case used covers only @acronym{ASCII} letters,
which means that case-insensitive comparisons and case conversions are
incorrect for non-@acronym{ASCII} letters.  This will eventually be
fixed.
@end deffn

@node Miscellaneous Character Operations, Internal Representation of Characters, Comparison of Characters, Characters
@section Miscellaneous Character Operations

@deffn procedure char? object
@cindex type predicate, for character
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is a character; otherwise returns
@code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure char-upcase char
@deffnx procedure char-downcase char
@cindex uppercase, character conversion
@cindex lowercase, character conversion
@cindex case conversion, of character
@findex char-ci=?
Returns the uppercase or lowercase equivalent of @var{char} if
@var{char} is a letter; otherwise returns @var{char}.  These procedures
return a character @var{char2} such that @code{(char-ci=? @var{char}
@var{char2})}.

@strong{Note}: Although character objects can represent all of Unicode,
the model of alphabetic case used covers only @acronym{ASCII} letters,
which means that case-insensitive comparisons and case conversions are
incorrect for non-@acronym{ASCII} letters.  This will eventually be
fixed.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure char->digit char [radix]
If @var{char} is a character representing a digit in the given
@var{radix}, returns the corresponding integer value.  If you specify
@var{radix} (which must be an exact integer between 2 and 36 inclusive),
the conversion is done in that base, otherwise it is done in base 10.
If @var{char} doesn't represent a digit in base @var{radix},
@code{char->digit} returns @code{#f}.

Note that this procedure is insensitive to the alphabetic case of
@var{char}.

@example
@group
(char->digit #\8)                       @result{}  8
(char->digit #\e 16)                    @result{}  14
(char->digit #\e)                       @result{}  #f
@end group
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn procedure digit->char digit [radix]
Returns a character that represents @var{digit} in the radix given by
@var{radix}.  @var{Radix} must be an exact integer between 2 and 36
(inclusive), and defaults to 10.  @var{Digit}, which must be an
exact non-negative integer, should be less than @var{radix}; if
@var{digit} is greater than or equal to @var{radix}, @code{digit->char}
returns @code{#f}.

@example
@group
(digit->char 8)                         @result{}  #\8
(digit->char 14 16)                     @result{}  #\E

@cindex character code (defn)
@cindex character bits (defn)
@cindex code, of character (defn)
@cindex bucky bit, of character (defn)
@cindex ASCII character
An MIT/GNU Scheme character consists of a @dfn{code} part and a
@dfn{bucky bits} part.  The MIT/GNU Scheme set of characters can
represent more characters than @acronym{ASCII} can; it includes
characters with Super and Hyper bucky bits, as well as Control and Meta.
Every @acronym{ASCII} character corresponds to some MIT/GNU Scheme
character, but not vice versa.@footnote{Note that the Control bucky bit
is different from the @acronym{ASCII} control key.  This means that
@code{#\SOH} (@acronym{ASCII} ctrl-A) is different from @code{#\C-A}.
In fact, the Control bucky bit is completely orthogonal to the
@acronym{ASCII} control key, making possible such characters as
@code{#\C-SOH}.}

MIT/GNU Scheme uses a 21-bit character code with 4 bucky bits.  The
character code contains the Unicode scalar value for the character.  This
is a change from earlier versions of the system, which used the
@acronym{ISO-8859-1} scalar value, but it is upwards compatible with
previous usage, since @acronym{ISO-8859-1} is a proper subset of
Unicode.

@deffn procedure make-char code bucky-bits
@cindex construction, of character
Builds a character from @var{code} and @var{bucky-bits}.  Both
@var{code} and @var{bucky-bits} must be exact non-negative integers in
the appropriate range.  Use @code{char-code} and @code{char-bits} to
extract the code and bucky bits from the character.  If @code{0} is
specified for @var{bucky-bits}, @code{make-char} produces an ordinary
character; otherwise, the appropriate bits are turned on as follows:

@example
@group
1               Meta
2               Control
4               Super
8               Hyper
@end group
@end example

For example,

@example
@group
(make-char 97 0)                        @result{}  #\a
(make-char 97 1)                        @result{}  #\M-a
(make-char 97 2)                        @result{}  #\C-a
(make-char 97 3)                        @result{}  #\C-M-a
@end group
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn procedure char-bits char
@cindex selection, of character component
@cindex component selection, of character
Returns the exact integer representation of @var{char}'s bucky bits.
For example,

@example
@group
(char-bits #\a)                         @result{}  0
(char-bits #\m-a)                       @result{}  1
(char-bits #\c-a)                       @result{}  2
(char-bits #\c-m-a)                     @result{}  3
@end group
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn procedure char-code char
Returns the character code of @var{char}, an exact integer.  For
example,

@example
@group
(char-code #\a)                         @result{}  97
(char-code #\c-a)                       @result{}  97
@end group
@end example

Note that in MIT/GNU Scheme, the value of @code{char-code} is the
Unicode scalar value for @var{char}.
@end deffn

@defvr variable char-code-limit
@defvrx variable char-bits-limit
These variables define the (exclusive) upper limits for the character
code and bucky bits (respectively).  The character code and bucky bits
are always exact non-negative integers, and are strictly less than the
value of their respective limit variable.
@end defvr

@deffn procedure char->integer char
@deffnx procedure integer->char k
@code{char->integer} returns the character code representation for
@var{char}.  @code{integer->char} returns the character whose character
code representation is @var{k}.

@findex char-ascii?
@findex char->ascii
In MIT/GNU Scheme, if @code{(char-ascii? @var{char})} is true, then

@example
(eqv? (char->ascii @var{char}) (char->integer @var{char}))
@end example

@noindent
However, this behavior is not required by the Scheme standard, and
code that depends on it is not portable to other implementations.

@findex char<=?
@findex <=
These procedures implement order isomorphisms between the set of
characters under the @code{char<=?} ordering and some subset of the
integers under the @code{<=} ordering.  That is, if

@example
(char<=? a b)  @result{}  #t    @r{and}    (<= x y)  @result{}  #t
@end example

and @code{x} and @code{y} are in the range of @code{char->integer},
then

@example
@group
(<= (char->integer a)
    (char->integer b))                  @result{}  #t
(char<=? (integer->char x)
         (integer->char y))             @result{}  #t
@end group
@end example

In MIT/GNU Scheme, the specific relationship implemented by these
procedures is as follows:

@example
@group
(define (char->integer c)
  (+ (* (char-bits c) #x200000)
     (char-code c)))

(define (integer->char n)
  (make-char (remainder n #x200000)
             (quotient n #x200000)))
@end group
@end example

This implies that @code{char->integer} and @code{char-code} produce
identical results for characters that have no bucky bits set, and that
characters are ordered according to their Unicode scalar values.

Note: If the argument to @code{char->integer} or @code{integer->char} is
a constant, the compiler will constant-fold the call, replacing it with
the corresponding result.  This is a very useful way to denote unusual
character constants or @acronym{ASCII} codes.
@end deffn

@defvr variable char-integer-limit
The range of @code{char->integer} is defined to be the exact
non-negative integers that are less than the value of this variable
(exclusive).  Note, however, that there are some holes in this range,
because the character code must be a valid Unicode scalar value.
@end defvr

@node ISO-8859-1 Characters, Character Sets, Internal Representation of Characters, Characters
@section ISO-8859-1 Characters

MIT/GNU Scheme internally uses @acronym{ISO-8859-1} codes for
@acronym{I/O}, and stores character objects in a fashion that makes it
convenient to convert between @acronym{ISO-8859-1} codes and
characters.  Also, character strings are implemented as byte vectors
whose elements are @acronym{ISO-8859-1} codes; these codes are
converted to character objects when accessed.  For these reasons it is
sometimes desirable to be able to convert between @acronym{ISO-8859-1}
codes and characters.

@cindex ISO-8859-1 character (defn)
@cindex character, ISO-8859-1 (defn)
Not all characters can be represented as @acronym{ISO-8859-1} codes.  A
character that has an equivalent @acronym{ISO-8859-1} representation is
called an @dfn{ISO-8859-1 character}.

For historical reasons, the procedures that manipulate
@acronym{ISO-8859-1} characters use the word ``@acronym{ASCII}'' rather
than ``@acronym{ISO-8859-1}''.

@deffn procedure char-ascii? char
Returns the @acronym{ISO-8859-1} code for @var{char} if @var{char} has an
@acronym{ISO-8859-1} representation; otherwise returns @code{#f}.

In the current implementation, the characters that satisfy this
predicate are those in which the bucky bits are turned off, and for
which the character code is less than 256.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure char->ascii char
Returns the @acronym{ISO-8859-1} code for @var{char}.  An error
@code{condition-type:bad-range-argument} is signalled if @var{char}
doesn't have an @acronym{ISO-8859-1} representation.
@findex condition-type:bad-range-argument
@end deffn

@section Unicode

@cindex Unicode
MIT/GNU Scheme provides rudimentary support for Unicode characters.
In an ideal world, Unicode would be the base character set for MIT/GNU
Scheme.  But MIT/GNU Scheme predates the invention of Unicode, and
converting an application of this size is a considerable undertaking.
So for the time being, the base character set for strings is
@acronym{ISO-8859-1}, and Unicode support is grafted on.

This Unicode support was implemented as a part of the @acronym{XML}
parser (@pxref{XML Support}) implementation.  @acronym{XML} uses
Unicode as its base character set, and any @acronym{XML}
implementation @emph{must} support Unicode.

@cindex Scalar value, Unicode
@cindex Unicode character
@cindex Character, Unicode
The basic unit in a Unicode implementation is the @dfn{scalar value}.  The
character equivalent of a scalar value is a @dfn{Unicode character}.

@deffn procedure unicode-scalar-value? object
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is a Unicode scalar value.  Scalar
values are implemented as exact non-negative integers.  They are further
limited, by the Unicode standard, to be strictly less than
@code{#x110000}, with the values @code{#xD800} through @code{#xDFFF},
@code{#xFFFE}, and @code{#xFFFF} excluded.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure unicode-char? object
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is a Unicode character, specifically
if @var{object} is a character with no bucky bits and whose code
satisfies @code{unicode-scalar-value?}.
@end deffn

The Unicode implementation consists of these parts:

@itemize @bullet
@item
An implementation of @dfn{wide strings}, which are character strings
that support the full Unicode character set with constant-time access.

@item
@acronym{I/O} procedures that read and write Unicode characters in
several external representations, specifically @acronym{UTF-8},
@acronym{UTF-16}, and @acronym{UTF-32}.

@subsection Wide Strings

@cindex Wide string
@cindex String, wide
Wide characters can be combined into @dfn{wide strings}, which are
similar to strings but can contain any Unicode character sequence.  The
implementation used for wide strings is guaranteed to provide
constant-time access to each character in the string.

@deffn procedure wide-string? object
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is a wide string.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure make-wide-string k [unicode-char]
Returns a newly allocated wide string of length @var{k}.  If @var{char}
is specified, all elements of the returned string are initialized to
@var{char}; otherwise the contents of the string are unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure wide-string unicode-char @dots{}
Returns a newly allocated wide string consisting of the specified
characters.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure wide-string-length wide-string
Returns the length of @var{wide-string} as an exact non-negative
integer.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure wide-string-ref wide-string k
Returns character @var{k} of @var{wide-string}.  @var{K} must be a valid
index of @var{string}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure wide-string-set! wide-string k unicode-char
Stores @var{char} in element @var{k} of @var{wide-string} and returns an
unspecified value.  @var{K} must be a valid index of @var{wide-string}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure string->wide-string string [start [end]]
Returns a newly allocated wide string with the same contents as
@var{string}.  If @var{start} and @var{end} are supplied, they specify a
substring of @var{string} that is to be converted.  @var{Start} defaults
to @samp{0}, and @var{end} defaults to @samp{(string-length
@var{string})}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure wide-string->string wide-string [start [end]]
Returns a newly allocated string with the same contents as
@var{wide-string}.  The argument @var{wide-string} must satisfy
@code{wide-string?}.  If @var{start} and @var{end} are supplied, they
specify a substring of @var{wide-string} that is to be converted.
@var{Start} defaults to @samp{0}, and @var{end} defaults to
@samp{(wide-string-length @var{wide-string})}.

It is an error if any character in @var{wide-string} fails to satisfy
@code{char-ascii?}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure open-wide-input-string wide-string [start [end]]
Returns a new input port that sources the characters of
@var{wide-string}.  The optional arguments @var{start} and @var{end} may
be used to specify that the port delivers characters from a substring of
@var{wide-string}; if not given, @var{start} defaults to @samp{0} and
@var{end} defaults to @samp{(wide-string-length @var{wide-string})}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure open-wide-output-string
Returns an output port that accepts Unicode characters and strings and
accumulates them in a buffer.  Call @code{get-output-string} on the
returned port to get a wide string containing the accumulated
characters.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure call-with-wide-output-string procedure
Creates a wide-string output port and calls @var{procedure} on that
port.  The value returned by @var{procedure} is ignored, and the
accumulated output is returned as a wide string.  This is equivalent to:

@example
@group
(define (call-with-wide-output-string procedure)
  (let ((port (open-wide-output-string)))
    (procedure port)
    (get-output-string port)))
@end group
@end example

@subsection Unicode Representations

@cindex Unicode external representations
@cindex external representations, Unicode
The procedures in this section implement transformations that convert
between the internal representation of Unicode characters and several
standard external representations.  These external representations are
all implemented as sequences of bytes, but they differ in their intended
usage.

@cindex UTF-8
@cindex UTF-16
@cindex UTF-32
@table @acronym
@item UTF-8
Each character is written as a sequence of one to four bytes.

@item UTF-16
Each character is written as a sequence of one or two 16-bit integers.

@item UTF-32
Each character is written as a single 32-bit integer.
@end table

@cindex Big endian
@cindex Little endian
@cindex Host endian
@cindex Endianness
The @acronym{UTF-16} and @acronym{UTF-32} representations may be
serialized to and from a byte stream in either @dfn{big-endian} or
@dfn{little-endian} order.  In big-endian order, the most significant
byte is first, the next most significant byte is second, etc.@: In
little-endian order, the least significant byte is first, etc.@: All of
the @acronym{UTF-16} and @acronym{UTF-32} representation procedures are
available in both orders, which are indicated by names containing
@samp{utfNN-be} and @samp{utfNN-le}, respectively.  There are also
procedures that implement @dfn{host-endian} order, which is either
big-endian or little-endian depending on the underlying computer
architecture.

@deffn procedure utf8-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf16-be-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf16-le-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf16-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf32-be-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf32-le-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf32-string->wide-string string [start [end]]
Each of these procedures converts a byte vector to a wide string,
treating @var{string} as a stream of bytes encoded in the corresponding
@samp{utfNN} representation.  The arguments @var{start} and @var{end}
allow specification of a substring; they default to zero and
@var{string}'s length, respectively.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure utf8-string-length string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf16-be-string-length string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf16-le-string-length string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf16-string-length string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf32-be-string-length string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf32-le-string-length string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure utf32-string-length string [start [end]]
Each of these procedures counts the number of Unicode characters in a
byte vector, treating @var{string} as a stream of bytes encoded in the
corresponding @samp{utfNN} representation.  The arguments @var{start}
and @var{end} allow specification of a substring; they default to zero
and @var{string}'s length, respectively.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure wide-string->utf8-string string [start [end]]

@deffnx procedure wide-string->utf32-le-string string [start [end]]
@deffnx procedure wide-string->utf32-string string [start [end]]
Each of these procedures converts a wide string to a stream of bytes
encoded in the corresponding @samp{utfNN} representation, and returns
that stream as a byte vector.  The arguments @var{start}
and @var{end} allow specification of a substring; they default to zero
and @var{string}'s length, respectively.
