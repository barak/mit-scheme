@cindex application hook (defn)
@cindex hook, application (defn)
Procedures are created by evaluating @code{lambda} expressions
(@pxref{Lambda Expressions}); the @code{lambda} may either be explicit
or may be implicit as in a ``procedure @code{define}''
(@pxref{Definitions}).  Also there are special built-in procedures,
called @dfn{primitive procedures}, such as @code{car}; these procedures
are not written in Scheme but in the language used to implement the
Scheme system.  MIT/GNU Scheme also provides @dfn{application hooks}, which
support the construction of data structures that act like procedures.

@cindex external representation, for procedure
In MIT/GNU Scheme, the written representation of a procedure tells you
the type of the procedure (compiled, interpreted, or primitive):

@example
@group
pp
     @result{}  #[compiled-procedure 56 ("pp" #x2) #x10 #x307578]
(lambda (x) x)
     @result{}  #[compound-procedure 57]
(define (foo x) x)
foo
     @result{}  #[compound-procedure 58 foo]
car
     @result{}  #[primitive-procedure car]
(call-with-current-continuation (lambda (x) x))
     @result{}  #[continuation 59]
@end group
@end example

@noindent
@cindex compound procedure
@cindex procedure, compound
Note that interpreted procedures are called ``compound'' procedures
(strictly speaking, compiled procedures are also compound procedures).
The written representation makes this distinction for historical
reasons, and may eventually change.

@code{compound-procedure?}, or @code{primitive-procedure?}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure compiled-procedure? object

@end deffn

@deffn procedure procedure-environment procedure
Returns the closing environment of @var{procedure}.  Signals an error if
@var{procedure} is a primitive procedure, or if @var{procedure} is a
compiled procedure for which the debugging information is unavailable.
@end deffn

@node Arity, Primitive Procedures, Procedure Operations, Procedures
@section Arity

@cindex arity
Each procedure has an @dfn{arity}, which is the minimum and
(optionally) maximum number of arguments that it will accept.  MIT/GNU
Scheme provides an abstraction that represents arity, and tests for
the apparent arity of a procedure.

Arity objects come in two forms: the simple form, an exact
non-negative integer, represents a fixed number of arguments.  The
general form is a pair whose @code{car} represents the minimum number
of arguments and whose @code{cdr} is the maximum number of arguments.

@deffn procedure make-procedure-arity min [max [simple-ok?]]
Returns an arity object made from @var{min} and @var{max}.  @var{Min}
must be an exact non-negative integer.  @var{Max} must be an exact
non-negative integer at least as large as @var{min}.  Alternatively,
@var{max} may be omitted or given as @samp{#f}, which represents an
arity with no upper bound.

If @var{simple-ok?} is true, the returned arity is in the simple form
(an exact non-negative integer) when possible, and otherwise is always
in the general form.  @var{Simple-ok?} defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure procedure-arity? object
Returns @samp{#t} if @var{object} is an arity object, and @samp{#f}
otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure guarantee-procedure-arity object caller
Signals an error if @var{object} is not an arity object.  @var{Caller}
is a symbol that is printed as part of the error message and is
intended to be the name of the procedure where the error occurs.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure procedure-arity-min arity
@deffnx procedure procedure-arity-max arity
Return the lower and upper bounds of @var{arity}, respectively.
@end deffn

@findex condition-type:wrong-number-of-arguments
The following procedures test for the apparent arity of a procedure.
The results of the test may be less restrictive than the effect of
calling the procedure.  In other words, these procedures may indicate
that the procedure will accept a given number of arguments, but if you
call the procedure it may signal a
@code{condition-type:wrong-number-of-arguments} error.  For example,
here is a procedure that appears to accept any number of arguments,
but when called will signal an error if the number of arguments is not
one:

@example
(lambda arguments (apply car arguments))
@end example

@deffn procedure procedure-arity procedure
Returns the arity that @var{procedure} accepts.  The result may be in
either simple or general form.

@example
@group
(procedure-arity (lambda () 3))         @result{}  (0 . 0)
(procedure-arity (lambda (x) x))        @result{}  (1 . 1)
(procedure-arity car)                   @result{}  (1 . 1)
(procedure-arity (lambda x x))          @result{}  (0 . #f)
(procedure-arity (lambda (x . y) x))    @result{}  (1 . #f)
(procedure-arity (lambda (x #!optional y) x))
                                        @result{}  (1 . 2)

@deffn procedure procedure-arity-valid? procedure arity
Returns @samp{#t} if @var{procedure} accepts @var{arity}, and
@samp{#f} otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure procedure-of-arity? object arity
Returns @samp{#t} if @var{object} is a procedure that accepts
@var{arity}, and @samp{#f} otherwise.  Equivalent to:

@example
@group
(and (procedure? @var{object})
     (procedure-arity-valid? @var{object} @var{arity}))
@end group
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn procedure guarantee-procedure-of-arity object arity caller
Signals an error if @var{object} is not a procedure accepting
@var{arity}.  @var{Caller} is a symbol that is printed as part of the
error message and is intended to be the name of the procedure where
the error occurs.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure thunk? object
Returns @samp{#t} if @var{object} is a procedure that accepts
zero arguments, and @samp{#f} otherwise.  Equivalent to:

@example

(procedure-of-arity? @var{object} 0)
@end group
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn procedure guarantee-thunk object caller
Signals an error if @var{object} is not a procedure accepting zero

@deffn procedure make-primitive-procedure name [arity]
@var{Name} must be a symbol.  @var{Arity} must be an exact non-negative
integer, @code{-1}, @code{#f}, or @code{#t}; if not supplied it defaults
to @code{#f}.  Returns the primitive procedure called @var{name}.  May
perform further actions depending on @var{arity}:

@table @asis
@item @code{#f}
If the primitive procedure is not implemented, signals an error.

@item @code{#t}
If the primitive procedure is not implemented, returns @code{#f}.

@item integer
If the primitive procedure is implemented, signals an error if its arity
is not equal to @var{arity}.  If the primitive procedure is not
implemented, returns an unimplemented primitive procedure object that
accepts @var{arity} arguments.  An @var{arity} of @code{-1} means it
accepts any number of arguments.

@end deffn

@deffn procedure implemented-primitive-procedure? primitive-procedure

@section Continuations

@deffn procedure call-with-current-continuation procedure
@cindex continuation
@cindex construction, of continuation
@cindex procedure, escape (defn)
@cindex escape procedure (defn)
@var{Procedure} must be a procedure of one argument.  Packages up the
current continuation (see below) as an @dfn{escape procedure} and passes
it as an argument to @var{procedure}.  The escape procedure is a Scheme
procedure of one argument that, if it is later passed a value, will
ignore whatever continuation is in effect at that later time and will
give the value instead to the continuation that was in effect when the
escape procedure was created.  The escape procedure created by
@code{call-with-current-continuation} has unlimited extent just like any
other procedure in Scheme.  It may be stored in variables or data
structures and may be called as many times as desired.

The following examples show only the most common uses of this procedure.
If all real programs were as simple as these examples, there would be no
need for a procedure with the power of
@code{call-with-current-continuation}.

@example
@group
(call-with-current-continuation
  (lambda (exit)
    (for-each (lambda (x)
                (if (negative? x)
                    (exit x)))
              '(54 0 37 -3 245 19))

                          ((pair? obj) (+ (r (cdr obj)) 1))
                          (else (return #f))))))
          (r obj))))))

(list-length '(a b . c))                @result{}  #f
@end group
@end example

@cindex non-local exit
@cindex exit, non-local
A common use of @code{call-with-current-continuation} is for structured,
non-local exits from loops or procedure bodies, but in fact
@code{call-with-current-continuation} is quite useful for implementing a
wide variety of advanced control structures.

Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated a continuation exists that
wants the result of the expression.  The continuation represents an
entire (default) future for the computation.  If the expression is
evaluated at top level, for example, the continuation will take the
result, print it on the screen, prompt for the next input, evaluate it,
and so on forever.  Most of the time the continuation includes actions
specified by user code, as in a continuation that will take the result,
multiply it by the value stored in a local variable, add seven, and give
the answer to the top-level continuation to be printed.  Normally these
ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind the scenes and programmers
don't think much about them.  On the rare occasions that you may need to
deal explicitly with continuations,
@code{call-with-current-continuation} lets you do so by creating a
procedure that acts just like the current continuation.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure continuation? object
@cindex type predicate, for continuation
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is a continuation; otherwise returns
@code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure within-continuation continuation thunk
@cindex continuation, alternate invocation
@cindex escape procedure, alternate invocation
@var{Thunk} must be a procedure of no arguments.  Conceptually,@*
@code{within-continuation} invokes @var{continuation} on the result of
invoking @var{thunk}, but @var{thunk} is executed in the dynamic context
of @var{continuation}.  In other words, the ``current'' continuation is
abandoned before @var{thunk} is invoked.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure dynamic-wind before thunk after
Calls @var{thunk} without arguments, returning the result(s) of this
call.  @var{Before} and @var{after} are called, also without arguments,
as required by the following rules (note that in the absence of calls to
continuations captured using @code{call-with-current-continuation} the
three arguments are called once each, in order).  @var{Before} is called
whenever execution enters the dynamic extent of the call to @var{thunk}
and @var{after} is called whenever it exits that dynamic extent.  The
dynamic extent of a procedure call is the period between when the call
is initiated and when it returns.  In Scheme, because of
@code{call-with-current-continuation}, the dynamic extent of a call may
not be a single, connected time period.  It is defined as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The dynamic extent is entered when execution of the body of the called
procedure begins.

@item
The dynamic extent is also entered when execution is not within the
dynamic extent and a continuation is invoked that was captured (using
@code{call-with-current-continuation}) during the dynamic extent.

@item
It is exited when the called procedure returns.

@item
It is also exited when execution is within the dynamic extent and a
continuation is invoked that was captured while not within the dynamic
extent.
@end itemize

If a second call to @code{dynamic-wind} occurs within the dynamic extent
of the call to @var{thunk} and then a continuation is invoked in such a
way that the @var{after}s from these two invocations of
@code{dynamic-wind} are both to be called, then the @var{after}
associated with the second (inner) call to @code{dynamic-wind} is called
first.

If a second call to @code{dynamic-wind} occurs within the dynamic extent
of the call to @var{thunk} and then a continuation is invoked in such a
way that the @var{before}s from these two invocations of
@code{dynamic-wind} are both to be called, then the @var{before}
associated with the first (outer) call to @code{dynamic-wind} is called
first.

If invoking a continuation requires calling the @var{before} from one
call to @code{dynamic-wind} and the @var{after} from another, then the
@var{after} is called first.

The effect of using a captured continuation to enter or exit the dynamic
extent of a call to @var{before} or @var{after} is undefined.

@example
@group
(let ((path '())
      (c #f))
  (let ((add (lambda (s)
               (set! path (cons s path)))))
    (dynamic-wind
      (lambda () (add 'connect))
      (lambda ()
        (add (call-with-current-continuation
               (lambda (c0)
                 (set! c c0)
                 'talk1))))
      (lambda () (add 'disconnect)))
    (if (< (length path) 4)
        (c 'talk2)
        (reverse path))))

@result{} (connect talk1 disconnect connect talk2 disconnect)

The following two procedures support multiple values.

@deffn procedure call-with-values thunk procedure
@cindex multiple values, from procedure
@cindex values, multiple
@var{Thunk} must be a procedure of no arguments, and @var{procedure}
must be a procedure.  @var{Thunk} is invoked with a continuation that
expects to receive multiple values; specifically, the continuation
expects to receive the same number of values that @var{procedure}
accepts as arguments.  @var{Thunk} must return multiple values using the
@code{values} procedure.  Then @var{procedure} is called with the
multiple values as its arguments.  The result yielded by @var{procedure}
is returned as the result of @code{call-with-values}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure values object @dots{}
Returns multiple values.  The continuation in effect when this procedure
is called must be a multiple-value continuation that was created by
@code{call-with-values}.  Furthermore it must accept as many values as

@node Application Hooks, Generic Dispatch, Continuations, Procedures
@section Application Hooks

@cindex application hook (defn)
@cindex procedure, of application hook
@cindex extra object, of application hook
@dfn{Application hooks} are objects that can be applied like procedures.
Each application hook has two parts: a @dfn{procedure} that specifies
what to do when the application hook is applied, and an arbitrary
object, called @dfn{extra}.  Often the procedure uses the extra object
to determine what to do.

@cindex apply hook (defn)
@cindex entity (defn)
There are two kinds of application hooks, which differ in what arguments
are passed to the procedure.  When an @dfn{apply hook} is applied, the
procedure is passed exactly the same arguments that were passed to the
apply hook.  When an @dfn{entity} is applied, the entity itself is
passed as the first argument, followed by the other arguments that were
passed to the entity.

Both apply hooks and entities satisfy the predicate @code{procedure?}.
Each satisfies either @code{compiled-procedure?},
@code{compound-procedure?}, or @code{primitive-procedure?}, depending on
its procedure component.  An apply hook is considered to accept the same
number of arguments as its procedure, while an entity is considered to
accept one less argument than its procedure.

@section Generic Dispatch

@cindex generic procedure
@cindex procedure, generic
MIT/GNU Scheme provides a generic dispatch mechanism that can choose
an action to take based on the types of a set of objects.  Performance
is guaranteed by the use of a hash-based method cache.

This is @emph{not} an object-oriented programming system, although it
can provide the basis for such systems.  The difference is that the
generic dispatch doesn't have any model for the relationship between
object types.  Instead, there is a flat space of types and methods are
selected by procedural examination of the given operand types.

@end menu

@node Generic Procedures, Method Generators, Generic Dispatch, Generic Dispatch
@subsection Generic Procedures

@cindex method, of generic procedure
The core of the dispatch mechanism is the @dfn{generic procedure}.
This is a procedure that is called in the usual way, but which
dispatches to a particular @dfn{method} based on the types of its
arguments.

@deffn procedure make-generic-procedure arity [name]
Returns a new generic procedure accepting @var{arity}.  @var{Arity}
must specify a minimum of one argument.

@var{Name} is used for debugging: it is a symbol that has no role in
the semantics of the generic procedure.  @var{Name} may be @code{#f}
to indicate that the generic procedure is anonymous.  If @var{name} is
not specified, it defaults to @samp{#f}.

Examples:

@lisp
(define foo-bar (make-generic-procedure 2 'bar))

(define foo-baz (make-generic-procedure '(1 . 2) 'foo-baz))

(define foo-mum (make-generic-procedure '(1 . #f)))

occurs.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure generic-procedure-arity generic

(which must be a list of objects), and @samp{#f} otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {condition type} condition-type:no-applicable-methods operator operands
This condition type is signalled when a generic procedure is applied
and there are no applicable methods for the given operands.  The condition's
@var{operator} field contains the generic procedure and the
@var{operands} field contains the given operands.
@end deffn

@deffn {condition type} condition-type:extra-applicable-methods operator operands
This condition type is signalled when a generic procedure is applied
and there are more than one applicable methods for the given operands.
The condition's @var{operator} field contains the generic procedure
and the @var{operands} field contains the given operands.
@end deffn

@node Method Generators, Dispatch Tags, Generic Procedures, Generic Dispatch
@subsection Method Generators

Generic-procedure methods are dynamically chosen by @dfn{generators},
which are procedures of two arguments.  Each generic procedure has a
set of associated generators.  Whenever the procedure is applied, each
associated generator is applied to two arguments: the generic
procedure and a list of the dispatch tags for the operands.  The
return value from the generator is either a @dfn{method} (a procedure
accepting that number of arguments) or @samp{#f}.  In order for the
application to succeed, exactly one of the generic procedure's
generators must return a method.

Once a method has been chosen, it is cached.  A subsequent call to the
generic procedure with operands of the same types will reuse that
cached method.  Consequently, it is important that generators be
@dfn{functional}: they must always compute the same value from the
same arguments.

@deffn procedure add-generic-procedure-generator generic generator
Adds @var{generator} to @var{generic}'s set of generators and returns
an unspecified value.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure remove-generic-procedure-generator generic generator
Removes @var{generator} from @var{generic}'s set of generators and
returns an unspecified value.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure remove-generic-procedure-generators generic tags
Calls each of @var{generic}'s set of generators on @var{tags} and
removes each generator that returns a method.  Returns an unspecified
value.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure generic-procedure-generator-list generic
Returns a list of @var{generic}'s generators.
@end deffn

As a convenience, each generic procedure can have a @dfn{default
generator}, which is called only when all of the other generators have
returned @samp{#f}.  When created, a generic procedure has no default
generator.

@deffn procedure generic-procedure-default-generator generic
Returns @var{generic}'s default generator.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure set-generic-procedure-default-generator! generic generator
Sets @var{generic}'s default generator to @var{generator} and returns
an unspecified value.

@cindex dispatch tag
@cindex tag, dispatch
A dispatch tag is an object that represents the ``type'' of an

associated dispatch tag.  Built-in objects like pairs or booleans have
predefined tags, while dynamically typed objects like records have
tags that are created as needed.
