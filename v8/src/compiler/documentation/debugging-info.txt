NOTES ON DEBUGGING INFO GENERATION IN LIAR 5.0


Liar 5.0's middle part works by transforming a piece of KMP
s-expression source code into a simpler program.  This poses the
challenge of tracking the transformations in order to produce
debugging information.

The final compiled program contains a set of observable points, each
point corresponds roughly to some step in the naive evaluation of the
program as in the 6.001 environment model.  The correpsondence is
approximate.  Several 6.001 steps may occur in between two adjacent
observable steps, for example, a whole batch of cons cells might be
allocated at once.  Sometimes a 6.001 step is broken into several
observable steps, for example (EXPT X 3) may be transformed into

	(* (* X X) X)

Now the inner combination becomes observable when X holds a value that
causes * to signal an error.



The goal of debugging information generation is to provide as much
information as possible in terms of the original program source (as
stored in the .bin file by SF) and the original environment model.


SOURCE EXPRESSIONS

Each KMP expression may be associated with a source expression.  This
expression also contains the environment *structure* at that point in
the program.

Each new KMP expression that corresponds to the same source expression
should be associated with the source expression.  (This is done via a
hash table).  Usually this is accomplished by the recursive traversal
of the KMP program.  If an expression is trivially translated into another expression then it is clear what to do.

Special attention is required when code is no longer in 1-1
correspondence with the input expression.  Example:

We may replace (CAR x) with a type-safe version:

	(if (%pair? x)
	    (%car x)
            (%primitive-error 'CAR x))

The IF expression, the call to %car and the call to %primitive-error
should all be associated with the source code that is associated with
the input `(CAR x)'.  This way, if a later phase can prove that only
one branch of the IF is ever taken then the information is still
available in the subexpression.

In the (* (* X X) X) case, what expression do we associate with the
inner combination?  The only possibility is to associate the singel
source expression with both combinations.  [TO DO: this approach gives
weird results - (EXPT X 3) is claimed to be a subproblem of itself.
This can be solved by adding an `outer' slot to each DBG-EXPRESSION
object, and using that.]



DEBUGGING REWRITES

The purpose of many KMP rewrite phases is to make some representation
change.  Each time we rewrite a VARIABLE to be some expression we note
this by calling

	(DBG-INFO/REMEMBER variable expression)

Provided that we follow the rules below, we can use the rewrite pairs
to reconstruct thos expressions which are still live.


General rules

. The program must be alpha-converted.

. If an object's representation is changed, use a new name.

. Only remember integrations (expression is (QUOTE <something>)) if
  *all* occurences of variable are being replaced.

. A common approach is to name a value in the compound, e.g. a closure
  slot may be named after the variable stored there.  Such a name is
  called a QUANTITY.

Compound objects.

This happens when one or more objects are stored in another object,
e.g. a cell or a closure.

 1. Introduce a new name N for the compound object.
 2. Rewrite component expressions as accessors
 3. Add a DBG rewrite of the form  X --> accessor(N)
    If using a quantity name, rewrite like this:  X --> accessor(N,'X)

Uncompounding

Any object that is to be uncompounded must have a quantity identifier,
thus, e.g. we may uncompound closure-refs but not vector-refs.

 1. In program, rewrite code to elide accessor.
 2. In DBG info, rewrite expressions to elide all accessors of that
    quantity.
 3. This requires that all source references to the compounded object
    are uncompounded.  If thus is not so we must remove ALL dbg
    expressions to that quantity.


Change of compound

Replace accessor-1 by accessor-2: like uncompounding except editing is
to replace rather than elide accessors.

i.e. replace  (accessor-1 N-1) by (accessor-2 N-2)


Dont know how to do

(accessor-1 (accessor-2 N-1)) --> (accessor-3 N-2)
