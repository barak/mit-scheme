Problems:

[] Stackopt is requires too much storage.  Investigate.

[DONE] Indexify should be dropped.  For large programs, fully 32% of the
program (measured in pairs) is %vector-index expressions after
cleanup/4 (closconv/2 leaves it at about 25%).

[] Teach dataflow about coerce-to-compiled-procedure

[] Reorganize coerce to keep the expressions small and unconditional
until much later.  Perhaps the right thing is to treat
coerce-to-compiled-procedure more like &+, expanding the in-line test
late.  An alternative is to have an assembly hook which creates a
trampoline or closure which can be overwritten later with the correct
value.

[] Investigate replacing %stack-closure-ref by a STACK-REF special
form. This would save 10 pairs per stack reference.

[] Why is the new code not more than 12% faster than the old code?

[DONE] Move split earlier, to after applicat.

[] Make split introduce closures with no code pointer as tuples.

[] Make dataflow realize that is does not have enough heap space
earlier.  Keep track of the number of nodes allocated thus far.  From
this we can calculate the minimum space for the fully connected graph
and give up if that much is not free after every GC.

[] Dataflow might benefit from a class heirarchy for the nodes, rather
than having to test a wierd combination of the form, name and type
slots.

[] Dataflow does not have to keep the transitive closure.  This could
save lots of space.


[PARTLY DONE] Figure out a way to get some debugging information (even
just an expression) into the `local' continuations.  Getting an
environment is harder but worth-while.

[] Fix lamlift, split and friends to maintain alpha-conversion wrt
extra stubs.

[] Fix rtlgen to make internal procedures again.  Bite the bullet.
Prescan the whole program to see if a letrec label is used in a
%make-trivial-closure.


[] RTLGEN.

RTLGEN should be rewritten in the following way to generate better
code.  (in an experiment ASSQ is 20% faster when done this way).

 . generate call graph
 . partition graph into DAGS by removing call edges.  Prefer removing
   edges that break loops, and then to procedures/continuations that
   we already know require in interrupt check.
 . Decide which procedures should have an interrupt check.
 . if a procedure is called from only one DAG, and does not have an
   interrupt check (e.g. by declaration) it may be implemented as a
   label, with pseudo-register arguments.  (perhaps this should be
   decided before compat?)
 . generate code for each DAG
    - generate code for a node before any of its children.  This is
      required so that we have the preservation information available.
    - collect allocation & stack statistics from children which do not
      have their own heap/stack/interrupt checks.
 . We now have the information to insert interrupt checks at the
   decided places.

 . at the same time fix the problem that is causing r#x13 to be copied
   at every procedure entry.


[] Incorporate RTL instruction scheduling


Missing functionality

[] Implement checked primitive procedures.  This requires a preserving
call to arbitrary primitives and debugging info for preservations.
PARTLY DONE -- type based rewriting replaces primitives with unchecked
versions if possible.

Implementation strategies

[UNLIKELY] Make all variables in the source code be represented by
structures to allow instant lookup.  Requires strict alpha conversion.


Extra functionality

[] Debugging information may be able to use the environment model for
subproblems (deeper stack frames) in certain circumstances.  Internal
procedures that do not escape and are only called as subproblems
(except for calling* themselves) from a fixed set of locations may be
able to augment available information from these stack frames.  (What
we must guarantee is that the instance of the subproblem stack frame
must the the same as the instance of the internal procedure's parent
frame).

[] Debugging information can be used to get values for
(sub)expressions that have already been computed.  For this to be
useful we should remove expressions whose value is available as a
binding (to avoid duplication, presumably frequent when the user has
used LET to bind the value).

[IN PROGRESS] Loop unrolling at KMP level.

[] Declaration for controlling the generation of interrupt checks,
heap checks and stack checks.  Declaration also for ensuring that a
procedure can be breakpointed?

[] Declaration for more live debugging information, at the expense of
performance.  This can be implemented by bogus references to the user
level bindings.  Two logical places to do this: before lamlift/1 might
cause extra closures to be generated, but gets all the bindings.
After lamlift/1 might cause extra stack references, but doesnt
generate closures and might miss those bindings.  Unless done
carefully this might cause lots of identity continuations.


[] Condition tree improvements.  Some kind of CSE on conditions to
make up for RTL's lack of boolean `registers'.  An open-coder for MEMQ
in predicate position might be helpful.

[DONE] Make SF integrate more procedures as
    (access <name> system-global-environment)
Include anything from R4RS that we can improve.

[DONE] Make the unsyntaxer hide all the `spurrious' accesses
introduced above.  There should be a flag which when set, elides the
access provided that the <name> would not be captured.
