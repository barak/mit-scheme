Title: MIT/GNU Scheme User's Manual
Author: Stephen Adams and Chris Hanson
Abstract: This document describes how to install and use MIT/GNU Scheme.
 It gives installation instructions for all of the platforms that we
 support; complete documentation of the command-line options and
 environment variables that control how Scheme works; and rudimentary
 descriptions of how to interact with the evaluator, compile and debug
 programs, and use the editor.  The release notes are included as an
 appendix.
