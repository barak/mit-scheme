Notes on the Edwin sources:

If you want to add a new file to the source tree, you need to 
modify the following three files:

	decls.scm
	ed-ffi.scm
	edwin.pkg

If the file should be loaded into the default edwin band, you must also
edit the file:

	edwin.ldr

If the file is to be autoloaded, you must edit the file:

	loadef.scm

So, in either case, you have to change four files in
"/scheme/v8/src/edwin".  Of course, you also have to put a copy of
your file in "/scheme/v8/src/edwin", too, and you have to put a link
to the new file in "/scheme/v7/linux/edwin".
