- Verify the branch condition codes.
- Verify variable-width cases.
- Open-coded flonum arithmetic.
- Better fixnum operations with constant operands.
- Fast division by multiplication.
- Fixnum multiply-add/sub/negate.
- Consider NaN-tagging.
- Write a disassembler.
- Change TYPED-CONS to tag Free into a temporary _before_ writing to it.
  Currently we do
    str x1,[x20],#8     // *Free++ = x1
    str x2,[x20],#8     // *Free++ = x2
    sub x0,x20,#16      // x0 = Free - 2
    orr x0,x0,#...      // x0 = (cons-pointer ... x0)
  We have enough temporaries that it shouldn't be a problem to allocate
  a temporary first and skip the sub step:
    orr x0,x20,#...     // x0 = (cons-pointer ... Free)
    str x1,[x20],#8     // *Free++ = x1
    str x2,[x20],#8     // *Free++ = x2
