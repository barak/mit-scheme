* Short documentation (how to compile files and add them to the microcode).

* Implement compile-procedure and compile-scode.

* Make fasdump work on compiled code by doing something similar to what
  happens with primitives.  Right now it is difficult because there is
  nothing to map back entry numbers to block numbers.

* Add ability to unload unneeded shared libraries (e.g. after
  disk-restore).
