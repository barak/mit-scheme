;; in the closure to allow GC to work correctly with relative jumps in
;; the closure code.  A better fix would be to alter the GC to make
;; absolute the addresses during closure transport.)
;;
;; The rule relies on the fact the REG-TEMP is a temporary for the

;; afterwards, and is specific in matching because it is the only code
;; that stores an entry at a negative offset from the free pointer.
