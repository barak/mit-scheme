;;;; Closure Analysis
;;; package: (compiler fg-optimizer closure-analysis)

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;; Theory behind this analysis.
;;;
;;; The closure analysis is really performed in two parts.  The first
;;; part is called "environment optimization", and is in
;;; "fgopt/envopt.scm".  The second part is called "closure analysis"
;;; and is in this file.  This naming is misleading, because only part
;;; of the environment optimization is in "envopt", while the code
;;; here implements a combination of closure analysis and environment
;;; optimization.  It would be more appropriate to merge the two files
;;; together.
;;;
;;; The analysis performed here consists of two basic operations.  The
;;; first operation is to decide what procedures need to be closures,
;;; and conversely what procedures may be closed over the stack.
;;; These latter are called "open" procedures.  We will call this
;;; operation "closure analysis".
;;;
;;; The second operation is to reorganize the environment "genealogy"
;;; in order to minimize the number of procedures that need to be
;;; closed.  We will call this operation "environment optimization".
;;;
;;; The closure analysis uses a handful of straightforward rules to
;;; decide whether to close a procedure.  These rules fall into two
;;; general classes: (1) The procedure is stored or invoked in a place
;;; where its ancestor environments aren't available on the stack;
;;; (2) The procedure is invoked from a place in which other
;;; procedures are also invoked, and so must be closed to provide a
;;; uniform calling interface amongst the procedures.
;;;
;;; The environment optimization is considerably more complex.  The
;;; basic algorithm is to take each procedure and raise it up in the
;;; environment heirarchy so that its closing environment is the
;;; top-level environment.  Then, a number of constraints are applied
;;; to the procedure, which together have the effect of pulling it
;;; back down the heirarchy as far as is necessary to satisfy the
;;; constraints.
;;;
;;; There are three basic constraints applied: (1) The closing
;;; environment must contain bindings for all of the free variables
;;; referenced by the procedure.  (2) The invocation environment of
;;; the procedure must include the closing environment of any
;;; procedure called from this procedure.  (3) Any environment in
;;; which this procedure is stored must include the closing
;;; environment of this procedure.  If all of these constraints are
;;; satisfied, then the procedure may remain open; otherwise it must
;;; be closed.

;;; The constraints are applied as a relaxation process in which the
;;; closing environments are slowly moved down the tree.  At points
;;; where it is discovered that it's not possible to satisfy the
;;; constraints for a given procedure, that procedure is closed.
;;; Closing of a procedure changes some of the constraints that depend
;;; on that procedure, allowing other constrained procedures to rise
;;; back up on the environment tree.
;;;
;;; There are several problems with this analysis, some of which are
;;; fundamental to the analysis, and some of which have to do with the
;;; implementation.  I will examine the implementation first.
;;;
;;; This implementation doesn't have a clear structure in which the
;;; constraints are properly reified and applied.  Instead, the
;;; application of the constraints is somewhat ad hoc, and what is
;;; reified is the end result of the constraint application rather
;;; than the constraint itself.  This means that the actual
;;; constraints are embedded in the code rather than being stated as
;;; data structures that can be reflected on.  Consequently there are
;;; several places where a given constraint is applied, and in each
;;; place the application is slightly different.
;;;
;;; A further problem is that several of the constraints are applied
;;; non-locally.  For example, places in which caller/callee
;;; relationships are analyzed look at the transitive closure of the
;;; caller/callee graph.  Instead, they should only examine the direct
;;; relationships.  This has two undesirable effects.  The first is
;;; that the optimization suffers, because the relationships are
;;; overconstrained.  The second is that the transitive closure
;;; depends on the _current_ state of the environment heirarchy, which
;;; means that there is feedback in the relaxation process.  This
;;; feedback makes analysis of the algorithm very difficult.
;;;
;;; This brings up my final point about the implementation.  The
;;; entire relaxation process involves a great deal of undisciplined
;;; feedback.  In addition to the transitive closure problem, there is
;;; also the ad hoc intermixing of constraint application and closing
;;; of procedures.  The end result of all of this is that the specific
;;; optimization computed here can't be described, because it depends
;;; on the specific order in which each action occurs.  And this in
;;; turn depends on the specific order in which procedures appear in
;;; lists, and the order in which MAP iterates over its argument list.
;;;
;;; In short, there's no way to prove that this implementation will
;;; converge, or that if it does it will result in correct code.
;;;
;;; An alternate strategy would be as follows.
;;;
;;; (1) Write down all of the constraints on the code as a set of
;;; equations.  Some of these equations would be conditional, in that
;;; they depend on things other than the environment heirarchy, such
;;; as whether or not a procedure is closed.
;;;
;;; (2) Raise up all of the procedures to the top level.
;;;
;;; (3) Apply all of the constraints to generate a new set of closing
;;; blocks.  Note that this computation must be based entirely on the
;;; old set of closing blocks, and thus has no feedback.
;;;
;;; (4) Any constraints that are left unsatisfied indicate procedures
;;; that may need to be closed.  Close one or more of them.
;;;
;;; (5) Continue iterating (3) and (4) until all of the constraints
;;; are satisfied, then modify the closing blocks of all of the
;;; procedures to the new ones implied by the constraints.
;;;
;;; This strategy has the major advantage that it is clear.  The
;;; absence of feedback means that the analysis can be understood, and
;;; it can be proven that this algorithm converges.
;;;
;;; The only real uncertainty is how effective the algorithm will be,
;;; and that is determined solely by step (4).  The choice of
;;; procedures to close isn't obvious.  A conservative choice would be
;;; to close all of them.  This will certainly result in correct code,
;;; but it is almost certainly non-optimal.  And this is the
;;; fundamental problem with this analysis: it is attempting to search
;;; a large space that doesn't have a known metric.  Consequently it
;;; is difficult to determine how to make it work well.
