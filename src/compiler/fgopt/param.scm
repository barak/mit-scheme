;;;; Argument Ordering Analysis

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;;; Procedure parameter analysis
#|

A procedure is eligible for having its parameters be placed in
registers (i.e. the procedure is "registerizable") if the procedure
will be inlined and the frame reuse routine has not tried to overwrite
anything in the stack frame of this procedure or the stack frame
associated with any ancestors of this procedure's block.

Assuming that a procedure is registerizable, the parameter analysis
phase determines which of it's parameters will indeed be passed in
registers.

A parameter will be passed in a register if all references to that
parameter in the procedure occur before any calls to complex
procedures. A complex procedure is essentially a non-inlined,
non-open-coded procedure. Additionally, we must check to make sure
that there are no references to the parameter in any closures or
descendent blocks. Note that inlined and open-coded procedures that
are called within the analysed procedure are considered to be part of
that procedure.

At certain times (when we hit an as yet unordered parallel) we have
the opportunity to suggest an ordering of subproblems for a particular
parallel. We take that opportunity to request an ordering which would
place a reference to a parameter before any calls to complex procedures.
The order-parallel! procedure is free to ignore our suggestions.

A major deficit with the current scheme is the restriction on
registerizable procedures caused by the frame reuse stuff. The frame
reuse code is very aggressive and consequently there are very few
occasions where we can in fact place parameters in registers. The
problem is that the frame reuse code needs to know the stack layout,
but the placing of parameters in registers affects the use of the
stack. And because the parameter analysis code may call the subproblem
ordering code which may call the frame reuse code, we have a very
tricky timing problem. The correct solution may be to use a relaxation
technique and iterate the subproblem ordering so that we can put more
parameters in registers.
