The register allocator provides a mechanism for allocating and
deallocating machine registers.  It manages the available machine
registers as a cache, by maintaining a "map" that records two kinds of
information: (1) a list of the machine registers that are not in use;
and (2) a mapping that is the association between the allocated
machine registers and the "pseudo registers" that they represent.

An "alias" is a machine register that also holds the contents of a
pseudo register.  Usually an alias is used for a short period of time,
as a store-in cache, and then eventually the contents of the alias is
written back out to the home it is associated with.  Because of the
lifetime analysis, it is possible to identify those registers that
will no longer be referenced; these are deleted from the map when they
die, and thus do not need to be saved.

A "temporary" is a machine register with no associated home.  It is
used during the code generation of a single RTL instruction to hold
intermediate results.

Each pseudo register that has at least one alias has an entry in the
map.  While a home is entered in the map, it may have one or more
aliases added or deleted to its entry, but if the number of aliases
ever drops to zero, the entry is removed from the map.

Each temporary has an entry in the map, with the difference being that
the entry has no pseudo register associated with it.  Thus it need
never be written out.

All registers, both machine and pseudo, are represented by
non-negative integers.  Machine registers start at zero (inclusive)
and stop at `number-of-machine-registers' (exclusive).  All others are
pseudo registers.  Because they are integers, we can use `eqv?' to
compare register numbers.

`available-machine-registers' should be a list of the registers that
the allocator is allowed to allocate, in the preferred order of
allocation.

`(sort-machine-registers registers)' should reorder a list of machine
registers into some interesting sorting order.

;; A map entry has four parts:
;;  HOME is either a pseudo-register (which has a physical address in
;;        memory associated with it) or #F indicating that the value
;;        can be flushed when the last alias is reused
;;  SAVED-INTO-HOME? is a boolean that tells whether the value in the
;;        live register can be dropped rather than pushed to the home
;;        if the last live register is needed for other purposes
;;  ALIASES is a list of machine registers that contain the quantity
;;        being mapped (pseudo-register, cached value, etc.)
;;  LABEL is a tag to associate with the computed contents of the live
;;        registers holding this value.  This allows individual back
;;        ends to remember labels or other hard-to-generate constant
;;        values and avoid regenerating them.
