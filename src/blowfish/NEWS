mit-scheme-blowfish 1.1 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-07-29
===================================================

Remove the boast from the ancient description in the manual.

mit-scheme-blowfish 1.0 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-06-22
===================================================

Replace the bfish Âµmodule.  The deprecated (runtime blowfish) package
now autoloads this plugin.

mit-scheme-blowfish 0.2 - Matt Birkholz, 2017-05-18
===================================================

Use byte vectors for binary data instead of strings.  This changes
every export except blowfish-file? and perhaps compute-blowfish-init-
vector IF you don't care whether the init vector is a string.  Every
procedure that previously accepted/returned strings now
requires/produces byte vectors.  If it accepted/returned generic ports
it now requires/produces binary ports.  If you are using the md5
plugin to produce a digest for blowfish-set-key, you're winning, with
blowfish-set-key at least; md5 digests are now byte vectors too.

mit-scheme-blowfish 0.1 - Matt Birkholz, 2016-02-19
===================================================

Use libtool and automake.
