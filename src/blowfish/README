The Blowfish option.

This plugin creates a (blowfish) package, a drop-in replacement for
the microcode module based (runtime blowfish) package.  It is built in
the customary GNU way:

    ./configure [--with-openssl=directory]...
    make all check install

To use:

    (load-option 'blowfish)
    (import-blowfish)

Import-blowfish will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the exports from
(runtime blowfish).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions blowfish/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (blowfish)
              blowfish-set-key
              ...))
