The Blowfish option.

This plugin creates a (blowfish) package.  It is built in the GNU
standard way (below).  It expects the blowfish library header file to
be available, but often headers are not installed with the library.
On Ubuntu, when using the OpenSSL library, the libssl-dev package must
be installed before running the configure script.  Other options
include the libcrypto++-dev package or any library that provides the
blowfish header.  (Some adjustment to the configure script may be
necessary.)

The GNU standard way:

    ./configure [--with-openssl=directory]...
    make all
    make check
    make install

The last command will attempt to create a subdirectory in the first
directory on Scheme's library path.  If that directory is not writable
by you, super-user privileges may be required.

You can put a writable directory at the front of your Scheme's library
path by setting the MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and
creating a short optiondb file.

    mkdir ~/.mit-scheme-x86-64
    echo "(further-load-options #t)" > ~/.mit-scheme-x86-64/optiondb.scm
    export MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=\
	~/.mit-scheme-x86-64:/usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64
    make install

To use:

    (load-option 'blowfish)
    (import-blowfish)

Import-blowfish will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the deprecated
exports from (runtime blowfish).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions blowfish/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (blowfish)
              blowfish-set-key
              ...))

Please see the manual for API details.  An Info version should have
been installed along with the plugin.  If you have a texlive or
similar TeX environment installed, then HTML and PDF versions of the
manual can be created with the GNU standard targets install-html and
install-pdf.
