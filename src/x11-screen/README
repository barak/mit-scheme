The X11-SCREEN option.

This plugin creates an (edwin screen x11-screen) package that
registers an Edwin display type named X11, an exact replacement for
the microcode module based X screen type.  The plugin is built in the
customary GNU way, except that it must be installed prior to running
tests.

    ./configure ...
    make all install check

To load:

    (load-option 'x11-screen)

Loading this plugin re-assigns bindings in (edwin) and (edwin
x-commands); any existing Edwin screens will stop working.  You must
load this option before starting Edwin.  If the DISPLAY environment
variable is set, Edwin will create X11 screens.
