The X11-SCREEN option.

This is a drop-in replacement for Edwin's X screen-type that uses the
X11 plugin rather than the x11 microcode module.  This plugin is not
part of the core build and can be built outside the core build tree in
the customary way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

The install target copies a shared library shim and compiled Scheme
files into the system library path, and re-writes the optiondb.scm
found there.  You can override the default command name "mit-scheme"
(and thus the system library path) by setting MIT_SCHEME_EXE.

To use: (load-option 'X11-SCREEN).  Edwin will then create X11 type
screens rather than X type screens.
