The X11-SCREEN option.

This option creates an (edwin screen x11-screen) package that is
autoloaded by Edwin's X display type.  It is built in the GNU standard
way (below).  It does not use the C/FFI but uses the X11 plugin's
Terminal API.

The GNU standard way:

    ./configure ...
    make all
    make check
    make install

The last command will attempt to create a subdirectory in the first
directory on Scheme's library path.  If that directory is not writable
by you, super-user privileges may be required.

You can put a writable directory at the front of your Scheme's library
path by setting the MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and
creating a short optiondb file.

    mkdir ~/.mit-scheme-x86-64
    echo "(further-load-options #t)" > ~/.mit-scheme-x86-64/optiondb.scm
    export MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=\
	~/.mit-scheme-x86-64:/usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64
    make install

To use:

This option is autoloaded by Edwin when the DISPLAY environment
variable is set.
