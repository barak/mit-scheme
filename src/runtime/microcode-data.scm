;;;; Compiled Code Blocks

#|

Compiled code blocks contain both nonmarked code and marked constants.

Code positions are referred to as OFFSETS, which start from the
beginning of the block and are measured in bytes.  The positions of
constants are referred to as INDICES, and use the normal index
numbering for vectors.  The conversion between offsets and indices is
specified by COMPILED-CODE-BLOCK/BYTES-PER-OBJECT, which should be set
to the correct value before these operations are used.

Note: This code needs to be changed somewhat.  MANIFEST-CLOSURES are
compiled-code-blocks, but the format of them is completely different.

The constants block in a compiled-code-block often has a linkage
section that you cannot just vector-ref into as it contains raw
amchine addresses.  COMPILED-CODE-BLOCK/MARKED-START returns the start
index of this area.  COMPILED-CODE-BLOCK/CONSTANTS-START returns the
start index of the area following the linkage section, which usually
contains constants derived from the source program.
