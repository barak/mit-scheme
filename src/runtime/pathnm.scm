;;;; Pathnames
;;; package: (runtime pathname)

(declare (usual-integrations))

#|

When examining pathname components, programs must be prepared to
encounter any of the following situations:

* The host can be a host object.

* Any component except the host can be #F, which means the component
  has not been specified.

* Any component except the can be 'UNSPECIFIC, which means the
  component has no meaning in this particular pathname.

* The device, name, and type can be non-null strings.

* The directory can be a non-empty list of non-null strings and
  symbols, whose first element is either 'ABSOLUTE or 'RELATIVE.

* The version can be any symbol or any positive exact integer.  The
  symbol 'NEWEST refers to the largest version number that already
  exists in the file system when reading, overwriting, appending,
  superseding, or directory-listing an existing file; it refers to the
  smallest version number greater than any existing version number
  when creating a new file.

When examining wildcard components of a wildcard pathname, programs
must be prepared to encounter any of the following additional values
in any component (except the host) or any element of a list that is
the directory component:

* The symbol 'WILD, which matches anything.

* A string containing implementation-dependent special wildcard
  characters.

* Any object, representing an implementation-dependent wildcard
  pattern.

When constructing a pathname from components, programs must follow
these rules:

* Any component may be #F.  Specifying #F for the host results in
  using a default host rather than an actual #F value.

* The host may be a host object.

* The device, name, and type may be strings.  There are
  implementation-dependent limits on the number and type of characters
  in these strings.  A plausible assumption is that letters (of a
  single case) and digits are acceptable to most file system.

* The directory may be a list of strings and symbols whose first
  element is either 'ABSOLUTE or 'RELATIVE.  There are
  implementation-dependent limits on the length and contents of the
  list.

* The version may be 'NEWEST.

* Any component may be taken from the corresponding component of
  another pathname.  When the two pathnames are for different file
  systems, an appropriate translation occurs.  If no meaningful
  translation is possible, an error is signalled.

* When constructing a wildcard pathname, the name, type, or version
  may be 'WILD, which matches anything.
