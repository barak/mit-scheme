;;;; Syntactic Closures
;;;  Based on a design by Alan Bawden.

;;; This is a two-stage program: the first stage classifies input
;;; expressions into types, e.g. "definition", "lambda body",
;;; "expression", etc., and the second stage compiles those classified
;;; expressions ("items") into output code.  The classification stage
;;; permits discovery of internal definitions prior to code
;;; generation.  It also identifies keywords and variables, which
;;; allows a powerful form of syntactic binding to be implemented.

;;; See "Syntactic Closures", by Alan Bawden and Jonathan Rees, in
;;; Proceedings of the 1988 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional
;;; Programming, page 86.
