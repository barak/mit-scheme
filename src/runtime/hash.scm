;;;; Object Hashing
;;; package: (runtime hash)

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;;; Object hashing

;;; The hashing code depends on weak conses supported by the
;;; microcode.  In particular, it depends on the fact that the car of
;;; a weak cons becomes #F if the object is garbage collected.

;;; Important: This code must be rewritten for a parallel processor,
;;; since two processors may be updating the data structures
;;; simultaneously.

;;; How this works:

;;; There are two tables, the hash table and the unhash table:

;;; - The hash table associates objects to their hash numbers.  The
;;; entries are keyed according to the address (datum) of the object,
;;; and thus must be recomputed after every relocation (ie. band
;;; loading, garbage collection, etc.).

;;; - The unhash table associates the hash numbers with the
;;; corresponding objects.  It is keyed according to the numbers
;;; themselves.

;;; In order to make the hash and unhash tables weakly hold the
;;; objects hashed, the following mechanism is used:

;;; The hash table, a vector, has a NMV header before all the
;;; buckets, and therefore the garbage collector will skip it and will
;;; not relocate its buckets.  It becomes invalid after a garbage
;;; collection and the first thing the daemon does is clear it.  Each
;;; bucket is a normal alist with the objects in the cars, and the
;;; numbers in the cdrs, thus assq can be used to find an object in
;;; the bucket.

;;; The unhash table, also a vector, holds the objects by means of
;;; weak conses.  These weak conses are the same as the pairs in the
;;; buckets in the hash table, but with their type codes changed.
;;; Each of the buckets in the unhash table is headed by an extra pair
;;; whose car is usually #T.  This pair is used by the splicing code.
;;; The daemon treats buckets headed by #F differently from buckets
;;; headed by #T.  A bucket headed by #T is compressed: Those pairs
;;; whose cars have disappeared are spliced out from the bucket.  On
;;; the other hand, buckets headed by #F are not compressed.  The
;;; intent is that while object-unhash is traversing a bucket, the
;;; bucket is locked so that the daemon will not splice it out behind
;;; object-unhash's back.  Then object-unhash does not need to be
;;; locked against garbage collection.

;;;; Rehash daemon

;;; The following is dangerous because of the (unnecessary) consing
;;; done by the interpreter while it executes the loops.  It runs with
;;; interrupts turned off.  The (necessary) consing done by rehash is
;;; not dangerous because at least that much storage was freed by the
;;; garbage collector.  To understand this, notice that the hash table
;;; has a SNMV header, so the garbage collector does not trace the
;;; hash table buckets, therefore freeing their storage.  The header
;;; is SNM rather than NM to make the buckets be relocated at band
;;; load/restore time.

;;; Until this code is compiled, and therefore safe, it is replaced by
;;; a primitive.  See the installation code below.
