;;; This compression program is based on the algorithm described in
;;; "Data Compression with Finite Windows", by Edward R. Fiala and
;;; Daniel H. Greene, Xerox CSL-89-3.  A version of this paper
;;; appeared in "Communications of the Association for Computing
;;; Machinery", 32(1), 1989.

;;; This is a one-pass lossless substitution algorithm.  The algorithm
;;; works by finding large blocks of text in the input stream and
;;; replacing them with shorter references to earlier occurrences of
;;; identical text.  In order to limit the amount of memory needed by
;;; the compressor and expander, a sliding "window" is used to
;;; remember the input stream, and "copy" references may only refer to
;;; text within that window.

;;; The output stream of the compressor is a series of "commands", of
;;; which there are two kinds: "literal" and "copy".  A literal
;;; command specifies a sequence of bytes that appear in the input
;;; stream.  A copy command is a reference to some earlier part of the
;;; input stream, consisting of a length field and a relative pointer
;;; to the position of the referenced text.

;;; Fiala and Greene describe five algorithms, which they name A1, A2,
;;; B1, B2, and C2:

;;; A1 and B1 use a simple encoding of commands that is suitable for
;;; byte-addressed machines.  This encoding is adequate for many
;;; purposes but does not achieve the compression ratios of the other
;;; algorithms.

;;; A2 and B2 use a more complex encoding that results in a
;;; significantly better compression ratio.  The price is that the
;;; compression and expansion are slower than that achieved with A1
;;; and B2.

;;; C2's encoding is even more complex, and results in the best
;;; overall compression ratio.  The compression speed of C2 is the
;;; same as that of B2, and the expansion is about 25% slower.

;;; A1 and A2 encode the relative pointers in copy commands as
;;; positions in the input byte stream.  B1 and B2 encode these
;;; pointers as positions in the output command stream, which the
;;; expander then translates back into byte positions.  The B
;;; algorithms speed up compression by approximately a factor of three
;;; over their A counterparts, while slowing expansion slightly.  The
;;; reason that compression is so much faster is that the A algorithms
;;; require much more complex data structures to keep track of the
;;; information in the window.

;;; C2 is like B2, except that it encodes further information about
;;; the data structures it is using to represent the window, assumes
;;; that the expander reproduces those data structures, and takes
;;; advantage of that assumption to achieve shorter references.

;;; This program implements the window data structures required by
;;; the algorithms B1, B2, and C2.  The encoder, which appears below,
;;; determines the algorithm.
