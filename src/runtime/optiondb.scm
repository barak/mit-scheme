;; This file contains Scheme code to define a set of load options.  Each
;; time a new (not-yet-loaded) load option is requested, this file is
;; loaded into a fresh environment which has the system global
;; environment as parent.
;;
;; Procedures used for defining load options:
;;
;; (DEFINE-LOAD-OPTION 'NAME loader loader ...)
;;   Defines a load option (NAME) which is loaded by the execution of its
;;   loaders.  Loaders are executed left to right.  Loaders are thunks.
;;
;; (STANDARD-OPTION-LOADER 'PACKAGE-NAME 'EXPR file file ...)
;;   Creates a loader that loads the files (strings relative to
;;   $MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH/runtime/) into the environment of the
;;   package named PACKAGE-NAME, and then evaluates EXPR in that load
;;   environment. If EXPR is #F of course evaluating it has no effect.
;;
;; (FURTHER-LOAD-OPTIONS EXPR)
;;   EXPR is the place to look next for the load options.  Useful objects
;;   are STANDARD-LOAD-OPTIONS (load options supplied with the
;;   MIT-Scheme distribution) and LOCAL-LOAD-OPTIONS (load options
;;   supplied for every user of your architecture at your site).  If
;;   not specified, or is #F, then this file is the last options
;;   database that is searched.

;; Standard load options are defined like this:

(define-load-option 'ARITHMETIC-INTERFACE
  (standard-option-loader '(RUNTIME NUMBER INTERFACE) #F "numint"))

;; We can use programming to make the definitions less noisy and tedious:

(for-each
 (lambda (spec)
   (define-load-option (car spec) (apply standard-option-loader (cdr spec))))
 '((COMPRESS	(RUNTIME COMPRESS)	#F			"cpress")
   (DOSPROCESS	()			#F			"dosproc")
   (FORMAT	(RUNTIME FORMAT)	(INITIALIZE-PACKAGE!)	"format")
   (GDBM	(RUNTIME GDBM)		#F			"gdbm")
   (KRYPT	(RUNTIME KRYPT)		#F			"krypt")
   (MIME-CODEC	(RUNTIME MIME-CODEC)	#F			"mime-codec")
   (ORDERED-VECTOR (RUNTIME ORDERED-VECTOR) #F			"ordvec")
   (POSTGRESQL	(RUNTIME POSTGRESQL)	#F			"pgsql")
   (RB-TREE	(RUNTIME RB-TREE)	#F			"rbtree")
   (STEPPER	(RUNTIME STEPPER)	#F			"ystep")
   (SUBPROCESS	(RUNTIME SUBPROCESS)	(INITIALIZE-PACKAGE!)	"process")
   (SYNCHRONOUS-SUBPROCESS (RUNTIME SYNCHRONOUS-SUBPROCESS) #F	"syncproc")
   (WT-TREE	(RUNTIME WT-TREE)	#F			"wttree")
   ))

(define-load-option 'REGULAR-EXPRESSION
  (standard-option-loader '(RUNTIME REGULAR-EXPRESSION-COMPILER)

			  "rgxcmp")

			  "chrsyn")
  (standard-option-loader '(RUNTIME REGULAR-EXPRESSION)

  (standard-option-loader '(RUNTIME REXP)
