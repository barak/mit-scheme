New arithmetic procedures:

- (sqrt1pm1 z) computes sqrt(1 + z) - 1, with low relative error even
  for values of z near zero
- (rsqrt z) computes 1/sqrt(z)
- (compound z w) computes (1 + z)^w, with low relative error even for
  values of z near zero
- (compoundm1 z w) computes (1 + z)^w - 1, with low relative error even
  for values of z near zero

Additionally, complex division avoids spurious overflow and underflow
much more often.

New floating-point procedures:

- (flo:sqrt1pm1 x)
- (flo:rsqrt x)
- (flo:compound x y) -- note y must be a flonum, not an exact integer
- (flo:compoundm1 x y)
