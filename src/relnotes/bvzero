New procedure (bytevector-zero-explicit! bv [start [end]]) intended not
to be optimized away.

This isn't correctly implemented yet -- an old copy of the data may
remain elsewhere in memory after a GC -- but it may be useful to mark
where you _would_ want to zero the bytevector if we fixed it in the
future.
