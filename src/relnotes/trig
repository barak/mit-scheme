- New procedures sin-pi*, cos-pi*, tan-pi*, asin/pi, cos/pi, atan/pi.

  These compute the standard trigonometric functions in units of
  half-revolutions rather than radians.

- New procedures versin, exsec, aversin, aexsec.

  These compute the historical trigonometric functions

    versin z = 1 - cos z
    exsec z = (1 - cos z)/cos z,

  which are useful because they are well-conditioned near zero unlike
  cosine, and as such were used in many historical trigonometric
  computations and tables.  (In contrast, the other trigonometric
  torments like secant and hacovercosine and excosecant aren't terribly
  useful.)

- New procedures versin-pi*, exsec-pi*, aversin/pi, aexsec/pi.

  These are like versin and exsec but in units of half-revolutions
  rather than radians.
