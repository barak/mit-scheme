New procedures for base-2 and base-10 exponentials and logarithms:

- (exp2 z)
- (exp10 z)
- (exp2m1 z)
- (exp10m1 z)
- (log2 z)
- (log10 z)
- (log2p1 z)
- (log10p1 z)

Additionally, logp1 is added as an alias for log1p.

These follow IEEE 754-2019, except that they are not necessarily
correctly rounded.
