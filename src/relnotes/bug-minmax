Bug fix: (flo:min x y) and (flo:max x y) now conform to IEEE 754-2008,
as minNum/maxNum.

When one input is a quiet NaN, they return the other input.  Only when
both inputs are NaN or one input is a signalling NaN do they return a
NaN, and in either case, it is a quiet NaN.  These trap only when the
floating-point invalid-operation exception is trapped.
