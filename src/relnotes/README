Release notes for upcoming release.

To add a release note, just create a new file with a short descriptive
name and put the text of the release note in it.  You can create
release notes on feature branches, and as long as the filename doesn't
collide with anyone else's, git will naturally merge them without
trouble in the directory.

When making a release, simply concatenate all the release notes in the
directory and then delete them.
