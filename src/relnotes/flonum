New flonum-related definitions:

. flo:radix - Floating-point radix.  This is essentially always 2 but
  useful for assertions if you want to future-proof code that assumes
  it with a noisy failure in case we ever violate the assumption.
. flo:error-bound - Greatest possible relative error in rounding to nearest.
. flo:log-error-bound = (log flo:error-bound)
. flo:ulp-of-one - Distance from 1 to next greater floating-point number.
  Equal to twice flo:error-bound.
. flo:log-ulp-of-one = (log flo:ulp-of-one)
. (flo:ulp x) - Distance from x to the next floating-point number
  larger in magnitude with the same sign.
. flo:normal-exponent-max-base-2 - Exponent of greatest power of two
  that is a floating-point number.
. flo:normal-exponent-min-base-2 - Exponent of least positive power of
  two that is a _normal_ floating-point number.
. flo:normal-exponent-max-base-e, flo:normal-exponent-min-base-e,
  flo:normal-exponent-max-base-10, flo:normal-exponent-min-base-10 -
  Exponents of the greatest and least positive powers of e and 10 that
  are normal floating-point numbers.
. flo:subnormal-exponent-min-base-2 - Exponent of least positive power
  of two that is a nonzero, subnormal floating-point number.  This
  number is the least positive floating-point number.
. flo:subnormal-exponent-min-base-e, flo:subnormal-exponent-min-base-10 -
  Exponents of least positive powers of e and 10.
. flo:smallest-positive-subnormal - Smallest positive subnormal.
. flo:smallest-positive-normal - Smallest positive normal.
. flo:largest-positive-normal - Largest positive normal.
. (flo:ldexp x e) = x * 2^e
. (flo:scalbn x e) = x * b^e, where b is flo:radix
