The PGSQL option.

This plugin creates a (pgsql) package, a drop-in replacement for the
microcode module based (runtime postgresql) package.  It is built in the
customary GNU way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

To use:

    (load-option 'pgsql)
    (import-pgsql)

Import-pgsql will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the exports from
(runtime postgresql).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions pgsql/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (pgsql)
              call-with-pgsql-conn
              ...))
