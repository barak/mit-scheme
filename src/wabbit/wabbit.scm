(define (wabbit-hunt wabbit-descwiptor #!optional fudd-thunk)
  "(WABBIT-DESCWIPTOR #!optional FUDD-THUNK)

   Procedure behavior:
   ------------------

   Open wabbit season on wabbits matching WABBIT-DESCWIPTOR and go wabbit
   hunting. Once all the wabbits have been wounded up, invoke FUDD-THUNK,
   weturning the wesult of FUDD-THUNK as the wesult of the wabbit hunt.
   
   The optional FUDD-THUNK pawameter defaults to the value of the fluid
   vawiable: *DEFAULT-FUDD-THUNK*, which defaults to just weturning the
   wabbit buffer (which will have been swabbed upon return!).

   Explanation of parameters:
   -------------------------

   A ``wabbit descwiptor'' is a 4-element vector:
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       0. Boolean hunt disable flag -- (a.k.a. ``duck season'' flag)
				       avoid wabbit hunting and/or headhunting
				       upon the next GC flip.

       1. Wabbit vector -- vector of object references to target objects
			   (a.k.a. ``wabbits'')

       2. Wabbit buffer -- vector into which wabbit sightings are recorded.
			   This must be of length (2 + twice wabbit vect len).

       3. Boolean headhunt enable flag -- if FALSE, no headhunt is performed.
					  else this slot will be replaced by a
					   headhunt collection upon completion
					   of the headhunting wabbit hunt.
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ****
    NB	a) Both the WABBIT-VECTOR and the WABBIT-BUFFER must reside in the heap
   ****	     i.e., they may *not* reside in constant space or on the stack.
	b) Both the wabbit buffer and the headhunt collection slots are zeroed
	    upon return, since they may contain unsafe pointers. Moreover, it
	    is unsafe for the FUDD-THUNK to return them or otherwise close over
	    them. Consider them only to be very fluid parameter sources for the
	    FUDD-THUNK.

   The ``wabbit buffer'' should be a vector of FALSEs before the wabbit hunting
   is initiated. At the end of the wabbit hunt, the wabbit buffer contents will
   be laid out as follows:
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     slot 0 = Boolean flag: TRUE  if all wabbit sightings were recorded in the
				     wabbit buffer
			    FALSE if the wabbit buffer was too small to accomo-
				     date a record for each wabbit sighting.
				     (In this case, the FUDD-THUNK should do a
				      bit of cleanup work so the same wabbit
				      hunt can be re-initiated later.)
     slot 1 = Fixnum: number of wabbit sightings recorded in the wabbit buffer
     slot 2 = Object reference: cite of first wabbit sighting (``wabbit hole'')
     slot 3 = Number: offset into first sighting object where wabbit is hiding
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ...and so on, with even-index slots containing wabbit holes and odd-index
   slots, indices. Note that slot 1 should hold the index of the first even
   slot that holds FALSE and all slots thereafter should likewise hold FALSE.

   A ``wabbit hole'' is normally a headed object reference (a pointer) but it
   may in very rare circumstances be a ``wascally wabbit hole''. There are only
   three kinds of wascally wabbit holes:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Characters: these indicate references to wabbit holes in constant space.
		   To reify the character into a cell whose contents holds the
		   wabbit, apply CELLIFY to the slot ref that holds the char.
		   (NB: the char as printed holds only part of the addr; you
			must vector-ref into the wabbit buffer to get all the
			addr bits. This is incredible magic.)
    2. Null  Refs: these indicate headless objects. They should never appear.
    3. Stack Refs: these indicate objects on the control stack. Since we reify
		   the stack into the heap as part of the call to WABBIT-HUNT,
		   these too should never appear unless you are doing something
		   painfully obscure (and dangerous!).

    If you ever encounter Null or Stack wabbit holes, you may want to send a
    friendly bug report (?) to bug-cscheme@zurich.ai.mit.edu with a repeatable
    test script.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The ``headhunt collection'' is a vector of arbitrary (fixnum) length. It is
   intended to contain a pointer to the head of every object in the heap which
   has an object header (spec., numbers, Booleans, etc not included). If all
   headed heap objects fit in the space available after the GC flip, then slot
   0 of this headhunt collection is TRUE. If not, slot 0 is FALSE and the vec-
   tor contains as many object head references as actually did fit.

 ************ Be verwy verwy careful when headhunting... if you are not careful
 ** CAVEAT ** to release the headhunt collection (e.g., SET! it to FALSE) or if
 ************ you gobble up too much intermediate state in traversing it, you
	      will exhaust the available heap space and go down in flames. This
	      is a very fragile system memory feature intended for only the
	      most ginger-fingered discriminating systems wizards. For instance
	      it may some day lead to a post-GC garbage scavenger. Nonetheless,
	      it readily lends itself to self abuse if not treated reverently.
