;;;; Major Mode for Java Programs

;;; This isn't a very good mode for Java, but it is good enough for
;;; some purposes and it was quickly implemented.  The major flaw is
;;; that it indents the body of a definition, such as a method or
;;; nested class, exactly the same as a continued statement.  The only
;;; way to treat these cases differently is to do more sophisticated
;;; parsing that recognizes that the contexts are different.  This
;;; could be done using the keyparser, but that would be much more
;;; work than this was.
