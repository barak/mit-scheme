The shell to use comes from the first non-#f variable found from these:
explicit-shell-file-name in Edwin, ESHELL in the environment or
shell-file-name in Edwin.

The buffer is put in Shell mode, giving commands for sending input
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.

The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name
such as `explicit-csh-arguments'.  If that symbol is a variable,
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell."
