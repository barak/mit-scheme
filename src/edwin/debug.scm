Commands:

`mouse-button-1'
     Select a subproblem or reduction and display information in the
     description buffer.

`C-n'
`down-arrow'
     Move the cursor down the list of subproblems and reductions and
     display info in the description buffer.

`C-p'
`up-arrow'
     Move the cursor up the list of subproblems and reductions and
     display info in the description buffer.

`e'  Show the environment structure.

`q'  Quit the debugger, destroying its window.

`p'  Invoke the standard restarts.

`SPC'
     Display info on current item in the description buffer.

`?'  Display help information.

   Each line beginning with `S' represents either a subproblem or stack
frame.  A subproblem line may be followed by one or more indented lines
\(beginning with the letter `R') which represent reductions associated
with that subproblem.  The subproblems are indexed with the natural
numbers.  To obtain a more complete description of a subproblem or
reduction, click the mouse on the desired line or move the cursor to the
line using the arrow keys (or `C-n' and `C-p').  The description buffer
will display the additional information.

   The description buffer contains three major regions.  The first
region contains a pretty printed version of the current expression. The
current subproblem within the expression is highlighted.  The second
region contains a representation of the frames of the environment of the
current expression.  The bindings of each frame are listed below the
frame header.  If there are no bindings in the frame, none will be
listed.  The frame of the current expression is preceeded with ==>.

   The bottom of the description buffer contains a region for evaluating
expressions in the environment of the selected subproblem or reduction.
This is the only portion of the buffer where editing is possible.  This
region can be used to find the values of variables in different
environments; you cannot, however, use mutators (set!, etc.) on compiled
code.

   Typing  `e' creates a new buffer in which you may browse through the
current environment.  In this new buffer, you can use the mouse, the
arrows, or `C-n' and `C-p' to select lines and view different
environments.  The environments listed are the same as those in the
description buffer.  If the selected environment structure is too large
to display (if there are more than `environment-package-limit' items in
the environment) an appropriate message is displayed.  To display the
environment in this case, set the `environment-package-limit' variable
to  `#f'.  This process is initiated by the command `M-x set-variable'.
You can not use `set!' to set the variable because it is an editor
variable and does not exist in the current scheme environment.  At the
bottom of the new buffer is a region for evaluating expressions similar
to that of the description buffer.

   The appearance of environment displays is controlled by the editor
variables `debugger-show-inner-frame-topmost?' and `debugger-compact-display?'
which affect the ordering of environment frames and the line spacing
respectively.

   Type `q' to quit the debugger, killing its primary buffer and any
others that it has created.

   NOTE: The debugger creates discription buffers in which debugging
information is presented.  These buffers are given names beginning with
spaces so that they do not appear in the buffer list; they are
automatically deleted when you quit the debugger.  If you wish to keep
one of these buffers, simply rename it using `M-x rename-buffer': once
it has been renamed, it will not be deleted automatically.")

Commands:

`mouse-button-1'
     Select a subproblem or reduction and display information in the
     description buffer.

`C-n'
`down-arrow'
     Move the cursor down the list of subproblems and reductions and
     display info in the description buffer.

`C-p'
`up-arrow'
     Move the cursor up the list of subproblems and reductions and
     display info in the description buffer.

`q'
     Quit the environment browser, destroying its window.

`SPC'
     Display info on current item in the description buffer.

`?'
     Display help information.

   In this buffer, you can use the mouse, the arrows, or `C-n' and
`C-p' to select lines and view different environments.
If the selected environment structure is too large to display (if
there are more than `environment-package-limit' items in the
environment) an appropriate message is displayed.  To display the
environment in this case, set the `environment-package-limit' variable
to  `#f'.  This process is initiated by the command `M-x
set-variable'. You can not use `set!' to set the variable because it
is an editor variable and does not exist in the current scheme
environment.

   The bottom of the description buffer contains a region for evaluating
expressions in the environment of the selected subproblem or reduction.
This is the only portion of the buffer where editing is possible.  This
region can be used to find the values of variables in different
environments; you cannot, however, use mutators (set!, etc.) on
compiled code.

   Type `q' to quit the environment browser, killing its primary buffer
and any others that it has created.

NOTE: The environment browser creates discription buffers in which
debugging information is presented.  These buffers are given names
beginning with spaces so that they do not appear in the buffer list;
they are automatically deleted when you quit the debugger.  If you wish
to keep one of these buffers, simply rename it using `M-x rename-buffer':
once it has been renamed, it will not be deleted automatically.")
