The GDBM option.

This plugin creates a (gdbm) package.  It is built in the customary
GNU way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

To use:

    (load-option 'gdbm)
    (import-gdbm)

Import-gdbm will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the deprecated
exports from (runtime gdbm).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions gdbm/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (gdbm)
              gdbm-open
              ...))
