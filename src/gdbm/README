The libgdbm wrapper.

This wrapper is not part of the core build and can be built outside
the core build tree.  There is no ./configure script yet.  If you know
you have libgdbm installed, you should win with this command:

	make build check install

The install target copies a shared library shim and compiled Scheme
files into the system library path.  You can override the default
command name "mit-scheme" (and system library path) by setting
MIT_SCHEME_EXE.
