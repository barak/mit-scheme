The GDBM wrapper.

This is a drop-in replacement for the gdbm microcode module and
runtime/gdbm.scm.  It is not part of the core build and can be built
outside the core build tree.  There is no ./configure script yet.  If
you know you have libgdbm installed, you should win with this command:

    make all check install

The install target copies a shared library shim and compiled Scheme
files into the system library path.  You can override the default
command name "mit-scheme" (and thus the system library path) by
setting MIT_SCHEME_EXE.

To load via load-option, install the following in your optiondb.scm:

    (define-load-option 'GDBM2 (guarded-system-loader '(gdbm) "gdbm"))

You will need to call it GDBM2 while GDBM refers to the original
microcode module.

You will need to import the bindings you want to use.  They are not
exported to the global environment because they would conflict with
the exports from (runtime gdbm).
