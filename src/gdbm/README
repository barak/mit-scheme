The GDBM2 option.

This plugin creates a (gdbm) package, a drop-in replacement for the
microcode module based (runtime gdbm) package.  It is built in the
customary GNU way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

To use:

    (load-option 'gdbm2)
    (import-gdbm2)

Import-gdbm2 will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the exports from
(runtime gdbm).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions gdbm/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (gdbm)
              gdbm-open
              ...))
