The GDBM option.

This plugin creates a (gdbm) package.  It is built in the GNU standard
way (below).  It expects the blowfish library header file to be
available, but often headers are not installed with the library.  On
Ubuntu the libgdbm-dev package must be installed before running the
configure script.

The GNU standard way:

    ./configure ...
    make all
    make check
    make install

The last command will attempt to create a subdirectory in the first
directory on Scheme's library path.  If that directory is not writable
by you, super-user privileges may be required.

To use:

    (load-option 'gdbm)
    (import-gdbm)

Import-gdbm will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the deprecated
exports from (runtime gdbm).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions gdbm/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (gdbm)
              gdbm-open
              ...))

Please see the manual for API details.  An Info version should have
been installed along with the plugin.  If you have a texlive or
similar TeX environment installed, then HTML and PDF versions of the
manual can be created with the GNU standard targets install-html and
install-pdf.
