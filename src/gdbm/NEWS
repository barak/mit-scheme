mit-scheme-gdbm 1.0 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-06-22
===============================================

Replace the gdbm Âµmodule.  Change the option name to "gdbm".  Rename
the import procedure "import-gdbm".  The deprecated (runtime gdbm)
package now autoloads this plugin.

mit-scheme-gdbm 0.4 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-06-01
===============================================

Accommodate gdbm 1.14 (in Ubuntu 18.04) but disable its file locking.

mit-scheme-gdbm 0.3 - Matt Birkholz, 2017-12-23
===============================================

Use new FFI Unicode support.  Include the gdbm manual, translated into
Scheme.

mit-scheme-gdbm 0.2 - Matt Birkholz, 2017-05-18
===============================================

Use new Unicode support.  Convert non-ASCII strings (keys and data) to
UTF8.  This assumes any other program adding non-ASCII keys or data is
using the same encoding.

mit-scheme-gdbm 0.1 - Matt Birkholz, 2016-02-19
===============================================

Use libtool and automake.
