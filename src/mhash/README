The mhash wrapper.

This is a drop-in replacement for the mhash microcode module and the
mhash-* procedures in runtime/crypto.scm.  It is not part of the core
build and can be built outside the core build tree in the customary
way:

    ./configure [--with-mhash=directory]...
    make all check install

The install target copies a shared library shim and compiled Scheme
files into the system library path.  You can override the default
command name "mit-scheme" (and thus the system library path) by
setting MIT_SCHEME_EXE.

To load via load-option, install the following in your optiondb.scm:

    (define-load-option 'MHASH
      (guarded-system-loader '(mhash) "mhash"))

You will need to import the bindings you want to use.  They are not
exported to the global environment because they would conflict with
the exports from (runtime crypto).
