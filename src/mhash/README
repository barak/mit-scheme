The Mhash option.

This plugin creates an (mhash) package, a drop-in replacement for the
microcode module based mhash-* procedures in the (runtime crypto)
package.  It is built in the customary GNU way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

To use:

    (load-option 'mhash)
    (import-mhash)

Import-mhash will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the exports from
(runtime crypto).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions mhash/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (mhash)
              mhash-file
              ...))
