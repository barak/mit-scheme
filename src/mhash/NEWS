mit-scheme-mhash 0.2 - Matt Birkholz, 2017-05-18
================================================

Use byte vectors for binary data instead of strings.  Thus all digests
and salts now must be byte vectors; the -update procedures must be fed
byte subvectors, not substrings.  Other changes: mhash-bytevector was
added, mhash-string takes optional start and end indices, so mhash-
substring was removed, and mhash-sum->hexadecimal and mhash-sum->
number were removed.  The latter can be replaced by bytevector->
hexadecimal and bytevector->exact-nonnegative-integer respectively.

mit-scheme-mhash 0.1 - Matt Birkholz, 2016-02-19
================================================

Use libtool and automake.
