/* NOTE: This program was created by translation from the regular
   expression code of GNU Emacs; it was translated from the original C

/* Structure to represent a buffer of text to match against.
   This contains the information that an editor buffer would have
   to supply for the matching process to be executed.

   `translation' is an array of MAX_ASCII characters which is used to
   map each character before matching.  Both the pattern and the match
   text are mapped.  This is normally used to implement case
   insensitive searches.

   `syntax_table' describes the syntax of the match text.  See the
   syntax table primitives for more information.

   `text' points to the beginning of the match text.  It is used only
   for translating match text pointers into indices.

   `text_start' and `text_end' delimit the match text.  They define
   the buffer-start and buffer-end for those matching commands that
   refer to them.  Also, all matching must take place within these
   limits.

   `gap_start' and `gap_end' delimit a gap in the match text.  Editor
   buffers normally have such a gap.  For applications without a gap,
   it is recommended that these be set to the same value as
   `text_end'.

   Both `text_start' and `gap_start' are inclusive indices, while
   `text_end' and `gap_end' are exclusive.

   The following conditions must be true:

   (text <= text_start)
   (text_start <= text_end)
   (gap_start <= gap_end)
   (! ((text_start < text_end) &&
       (gap_start < gap_end) &&
       ((text_start == gap_start) || (text_end == gap_end))))
