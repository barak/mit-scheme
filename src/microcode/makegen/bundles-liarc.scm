;;;; Bundles for LIARC to be linked into dynamically loadable shared
;;;; objects.

;;; Format: (bundle (package*) source-directory*)
;;;   bundle ::= string
;;;   package ::= pathname | (pathname os-type*)
;;;   source-directory ::= (pathname exclude-filename*)

;++ This is fragile: excluding filenames is bogus.  But it will work
;++ until we get a real module system.

;; These are listed alphabetically; I don't think the order matters.
