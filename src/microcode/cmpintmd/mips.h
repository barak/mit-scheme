/* Trampolines

   On the MIPS, here's a picture of a trampoline (offset in bytes from
   entry point)

     - 8: NON_MARKED header
     - 4: Format word
     - 2: 0x6 (GC Offset to start of block from .+2)
          Note the encoding -- divided by 2, low bit for
          extended distances (see OFFSET_WORD_TO_BYTE_OFFSET)
       0: ADDI  TEMP,SCHEME_TO_INTERFACE,-96
       4: JALR	LINKAGE,TEMP
       8: ADDI	TRAMP_INDEX,0,index
      12: trampoline dependent storage (0 - 3 longwords)

   TRAMPOLINE_ENTRY_SIZE is the size in longwords of the machine
   dependent portion of a trampoline, including the GC and format
   headers.  The code in the trampoline must store an index (used to
   determine which C SCHEME_UTILITY procedure to invoke) in a
   register, jump to "scheme_to_interface" and leave the address of
   the storage following the code in a standard location.

   TRAMPOLINE_ENTRY_POINT returns the address of the entry point of a
   trampoline when given the address of the word containing
   the manifest vector header.  According to the above picture,
   it would add 12 bytes to its argument.

   TRAMPOLINE_STORAGE takes the address of the first instruction in a
   trampoline (not the start of the trampoline block) and returns the
   address of the first storage word in the trampoline.

   STORE_TRAMPOLINE_ENTRY gets the address of the first instruction in
   the trampoline and stores the instructions.  It also receives the
   index of the C SCHEME_UTILITY to be invoked.
