/* Kinds of traps:

   For efficiency, some traps are immediate, while some are
   pointer objects.  The type code is multiplexed, and the
   garbage collector handles it specially.

   The odd-numbered traps used to be "dangerous" versions of the
   even-numbered ones, but all that complexity has been flushed.  */

typedef unsigned long trap_kind_t;

/* The following are immediate traps: */
#define TRAP_UNASSIGNED				0
#define TRAP_UNBOUND				2
#define TRAP_EXPENSIVE				6
/* TRAP_MAX_IMMEDIATE is defined in object.h */

/* The following are non-immediate traps: */
#define TRAP_COMPILER_CACHED			14
#define TRAP_MACRO				15

/* Usages of the above traps:
   TRAP_UNASSIGNED can appear in a value cell or a cache.
   TRAP_UNBOUND can appear in the following locations:
     * The value cell of a global variable.  All symbols initially
       have their value cell set to UNBOUND_OBJECT.
     * A cache that is in the value cell of a global variable.  This
       is like the previous case except that some compiled code has
       referenced the unbound variable.
     * The value cell of a procedure's argument frame.  This is caused
       by calling unbind_variable on a procedure's argument.
     * A cache that is not stored in an environment.  This is caused
       by referring to an unbound variable in an environment that does
       not inherit from the global environment.
   TRAP_EXPENSIVE can only appear in a "clone" cache.  This causes
     assignments to this cache to trap out to the microcode, where the
     updating of the variable's associated UUO links can be performed.
   TRAP_COMPILER_CACHED can only appear in a value cell.  It is used
     to associate a cache with the variable.
   TRAP_MACRO can appear in a value cell or a cache.  It is used for
   storage of macro transformers in the environment structure.
