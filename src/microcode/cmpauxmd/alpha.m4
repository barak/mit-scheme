 ### Alpha Architecture assembly language part of the compiled
 ### code interface. See cmpint.txt, cmpint.c, cmpint-alpha.h, and
 ### cmpgc.h for more documentation.
 ###
 ### NOTE:
 ###	Assumptions:
 ###
 ###	1) The C compiler divides registers into three groups:
 ###	- Linkage registers, used for procedure calls and global
 ###	references.  On Alpha: 26 (return address), 27 (procedure
 ###	descriptor), 28 (assembler temp), 29 (global pointer),
 ###	30 (stack pointer), and 31 (always 0).
 ###	- super temporaries, not preserved accross procedure calls and
 ###	always usable. On Alpha: 0-8, 16-21 (argument registers), and
 ###	22-25.  Values are returned in 0.
 ###	- preserved registers saved by the callee if they are written.
 ###	On Alpha: 9-14, 15 (frame base)
 ###
 ###	2) Arguments, if passed on a stack, are popped by the caller.
 ###	Thus most "leaf" procedures need not worry about them. On
 ###	Alpha: The first six arguments are passed in registers and
 ###	have no space allocated on the stack.  Integer scalars are
 ###	returned in register 0; floating point scalars are returned
 ###	in fp0; floating point complex numbers are returned in fp0 and
 ###	fp1; structured values are returned through a pointer passed
 ###	in the first argument register and the remaining arguments are
 ###	shifted over by one register.
 ###
 ###	3) There is a hardware or software maintained stack for
 ###	control.  The procedure calling sequence may leave return
 ###	addresses in registers, but they must be saved somewhere for
 ###	nested calls and recursive procedures.  On Alpha: Passed in a
 ###	register, and no slot stack exists.  The return link is in 26.
 ###	The (C) stack pointer is in 30.
 ###
 ###	4) C procedures return long values in a super temporary
 ###	register.  Alpha: two or more word structures are returned in
 ###	a location specified by the contents of the first argument
 ###	register, and all other arguments are shifted over one
 ###	location (i.e.  apparent argument 1 is passed in the register
 ###	usually used for argument 2, etc.)
 ###
 ###	5) On Alpha we don't know the floating point register save
 ###	convention yet.
 ###
 ### Compiled Scheme code uses the following register convention.
 ### Note that scheme_to_interface, the register block, the closure
 ### hook, link_to_interface, compiled_entry_type_bits, and
 ### closure_free are preserved by C calls, but the others are not,
 ### since they change dynamically.  trampoline_to_interface can be
 ### reached at a fixed offset from scheme_to_interface.
 ###
