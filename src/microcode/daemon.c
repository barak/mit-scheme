/* This file contains code for the Garbage Collection daemons.
   There are currently two daemons, one for closing files which
   have disappeared due to GC, the other for supporting object
   hash tables where entries disappear when the corresponding
   object is released due to GC.

   Both of these daemons should be written in Scheme, but since the
   interpreter conses while executing Scheme programs, they are
   unsafe.  The Scheme versions actually exist, but are commented out
   of the appropriate runtime system sources. */
