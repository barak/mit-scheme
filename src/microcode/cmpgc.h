/* When the target address of a closure is stored as a relative

   these targets.

   DECLARE_RELOCATION_REFERENCE(reference) declares a variable to hold
   reference information when code pointers are relative.

   START_CLOSURE_RELOCATION(block_addr, reference) is called
   immediately before relocating a block of closure entries.  */
