mit-scheme-x11 1.3 - Matt Birkholz, 2019-01-23
==============================================

Fix the x-graphics-vdc-extent and x-graphics-set-clip-rectangle
procedures.  Rename the device type "x".

mit-scheme-x11 1.2 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-07-29
==============================================

Fix the x-list-fonts procedure.

mit-scheme-x11 1.1 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-07-12
==============================================

Actually export the import-x11 procedure to the global environment.

mit-scheme-x11 1.0 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-06-21
==============================================

Replace the prx11.so Âµcode module.  Add an import-x11 procedure.  The
deprecated (runtimem x-graphics) package now autoloads this plugin.

mit-scheme-x11 0.3 - Matt Birkholz, 2018-06-01
==============================================

Allow CurrentTime as a Time argument (to fix an intermittent error
when cutting/pasting).

mit-scheme-x11 0.2 - Matt Birkholz, 2017-05-23
==============================================

Use new Unicode support.  Convert (restrict) strings (atom names and
xterm content) to iso8859-1.  This should be transparent if you were
using standard Latin1 property names and writing only Latin1 graphical
characters to your xterms.

mit-scheme-x11 0.1 - Matt Birkholz, 2016-02-19
==============================================

Converted to a libtool plugin.  Moved X11 data parsing
(x_event_to_object) to Scheme/FFI code.
