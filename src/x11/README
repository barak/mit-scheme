The X11 option.

This plugin creates an (x11) package.  It is built in the customary
GNU way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

To use:

    (load-option 'x11)
    (import-x11)

Import-x11 will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the deprecated
exports from (runtime x-graphics).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions x11/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (x11)
              xterm-open-window
              ...))
