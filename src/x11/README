The X11 option.

This plugin creates an (x11) package, a drop-in replacement for the
microcode module based (runtime x-graphics) package.  It is built in
the customary GNU way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

To load:

    (load-option 'x11)

Loading this plugin re-assigns the bindings in (runtime x-graphics).
Any existing X graphics devices will stop working, and make-graphics-
device will begin creating X11 graphics devices instead.

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions x11/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (x11)
              xterm-open-window
              ...))
