The X11 option.

This is a drop-in replacement for the x11 microcode module and
runtime/x11graph.scm.  It is not part of the core build and can be
built outside the core build tree in the customary way:

    ./configure ...
    make all check install

The install target copies a shared library shim and compiled Scheme
files into the system library path, and re-writes the optiondb.scm
found there.  You can override the default command name "mit-scheme"
(and thus the system library path) by setting MIT_SCHEME_EXE.

To use: (load-option 'X11) and import the bindings you want.  They are
not exported to the global environment because they would conflict
with the exports from (runtime x-graphics).  Once this option is
loaded, make-graphics-device will create X11 graphics devices rather
than X graphics devices.
