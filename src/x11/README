The X11 option.

This plugin creates an (x11) package.  It is built in the GNU standard
way (below).  It expects the pkg-config command to know about x11, and
for certain auxiliary headers to be available.  On Ubuntu this means
the pkg-config, libx11-dev and x11proto-dev packages must be installed
before running the configure script.

The GNU standard way:

    ./configure ...
    make all
    make check
    make install

The last command will attempt to create a subdirectory in the first
directory on Scheme's library path.  If that directory is not writable
by you, super-user privileges may be required.

You can put a writable directory at the front of your Scheme's library
path by setting the MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and
creating a short optiondb file.

    mkdir ~/.mit-scheme-x86-64
    echo "(further-load-options #t)" > ~/.mit-scheme-x86-64/optiondb.scm
    export MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=\
	~/.mit-scheme-x86-64:/usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64
    make install

To use:

    (load-option 'x11)
    (import-x11)

Import-x11 will modify the REPL's current environment by adding
bindings linked to the plugin's exports.  They are not exported to the
global environment because they would conflict with the deprecated
exports from (runtime x-graphics).

To import into a CREF package set, add this to your .pkg file:

    (global-definitions x11/)

    (define-package (your package name)
      (parent (your package parent))
      (import (x11)
              xterm-open-window
              ...))
